AirAsia India,6,"""crew were welcoming""",V Bakshi,14th October 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I had booked this fare at a very discounted rate as I needed to travel back to BLR. The check in experience was good, I had arrived early and there was still time for check in to open so I was told to wait for 30 mins before check in in my luggage. Post that I had noticed that the inbound was delayed due to which the departure was also slightly delayed by 40 mins. The crew were welcoming and this flight was not completely full. During boarding I had noticed that a lot of people had come with trolleys and they were told to check in their luggage which is good as a lot of folks come carrying big trolleys that just block the cabin overhead bins. The flight tried to make time en route and landing in BLR was swift along with luggage retrieval. One point to note here is that the seat pitch may be on the tighter side compared to other airlines but otherwise this was a good trip where the crew also distributed water bottles to everyone during boarding.",yes
AirAsia India,1,"""furious and disappointed""",G Oscar,14th October 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I travel at least four times a month and Air Asia truly ruins any flight that I have to unwillingly take with them. With the horrible past experiences I made it a point to never book this airline but some times due to emergencies I had to resort to this and as I expected I was so furious and disappointed by the end of it. The staff isn’t trained at all and I don’t think they’re equipped for basic customer management. They are angry, rude and unbothered. Worse is, I think they’re so frustrated with where they are working",no
AirAsia India,10,"""amazing service and support""",Rahul Verma,14th October 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Taking this opportunity to appreciate and thank the entire team of I5 792 for providing amazing service and support during the entire journey and making it a memorable one. I have traveled a lot however this was the first time for my parents and trust me it could not have been better than this if it wasn’t the crew who made it happen, specially Mr Shubham the cabin supervisor. He is extremely polite, professional and empathetic. He treated my family like his own and was very polite and respectful to all the other customers as far I noticed. I wish to see cabin crew like him on all flights because they are the ones who make a difference. Would also like to highlight his amazing announcements, loud and clear unlike many other. Once again thank you everyone for an amazing experience hope to see you all in future on AirAsia flights.",yes
AirAsia India,1,"""Waste of time and money""",G Akron,14th October 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | The worst airlines in the history of mankind. Absolutely hate it, won't recommend at all. Stay away from it and go for Indigo or Akasa. Waste of time and money.",no
AirAsia India,8,"""thumbs up to boarding crew""",Sirajudeen Jawahar ali,14th October 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Would like to give big thumbs up to boarding crew Ms Noor at Tiruchirappalli Airport.

AirAsia India,9,"""Services were good""",Arpita Chatterjee,14th October 2023,Not Verified |  My mother travelled alone in Air Asia on 07 June 2023. The flight was very comfortable. Services were good. Ground staff was extremely helpful. Sincere thanks to the ticketing staff.,yes
AirAsia India,10,"""thank entire staff of Air Asia""",Sharayu Parab,14th October 2023,✅ Trip Verified |  I will like to thank entire staff of Air Asia. We were on family vacation with my 2.6 year old child and got amazing cooperation. Without any hassle we could book seats and the entire journey was enjoyable. Will like to be thankful to the pilots as the landing on all the flights was smooth. I paid my gratitude to the staff personally too.,yes
AirAsia India,10,"""impressed with her fluency""",N Padesh,14th October 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Special appreciation to the cabin crew Sonika. I was super impressed with her fluency in announcements, all three different languages and it was just amazing to hear her out.",yes
AirAsia India,1,"""completely unacceptable behaviour""",V Krishnan,14th October 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed to be travelling from Bangalore to kochi on the AirAsia flight on March 23. We reached the Airport on time but because they didn't mention that the flight is in the newly launched terminal. We were late to reach the boarding gate but even though there was still time to board the flight, the crew didn't allow to board the flight. We knew this because when we where waiting to leave from the second terminal 15 minutes after not allowed entry another Airasia crew asked tried to help us to board the same flight 15 minutes after being denied entry. This is completely unacceptable behaviour unexpected from AirAsia India and we will make sure not to choose this flight again in future.",no
AirAsia India,8,"""hospitality and customer delight""",Kartika Rai,14th October 2023,✅ Trip Verified | Airline staff helped me with last minute web check in cancellation also helped locating the luggage and provided the best support and service. 5/5 for such hospitality and customer delight,yes
AirAsia India,10,"""customer service was excellent""",S Haraye,7th April 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  First time flying with Airasia. Hospitality and customer service was excellent. I arrived late in airport due to my car got an accident and check in gate was closed. However upon requesting airline staff that I have international connection, they allowed and assisted me in getting to the aircraft. A very big thank you to AirAsia India for making my travel successful.",yes
AirAsia India,10,"""exceptionally great service""",J Verlin,7th April 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  I must mention about this this exceptionally great service rendered by AirAsia. I travelled in the Air Asia I5 472 from Goa to Mumbai on 18 December at 1 am. On arriving at Mumbai, my mother realised that she forgot to carry one of her bag from Goa airport to the flight. I can't explain in words how Air Asia has gone out of their way to get my bag from the Lost and Found Department, and send it to Mumbai by the earliest flight all free. The bag reached us in Mumbai safe and sound. I recommend Air Asia services as their way of handling their customers before flying, during the flight, and after flight is too good.",yes
AirAsia India,6,"""Overall not a bad experience""",Rahul Anand,7th April 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Airline with most compact seat arrangements. Iwould avoid this but in last moment its fare was cheapest from Delhi to Jaipur. Icing on the cake was I got last row window seat as it was the only row which was Available, fortunately no one was there in the middle seat so little bit of comfort. Departed on time and reached Jaipur before time. Cabin crew looks courteous but as it was early morning 5 am flight so after boarding slept all time so never needed to interact with them. Seats are compact as i said earlier. Overall not a bad experience for less than hour ling flight.",yes
AirAsia India,6,"""most congested seating""",Rahul Anand,7th April 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Service was ok, on time boarding and departure and so was arrival. Cabin crew were courteous but with respect to any other airline in India it has the least legroom, most congested seating configuration I found in India. This is one reason which makes me rethink before booking next flight with them.",no
AirAsia India,6,"""most congested seating configuration I found in India""",Rahul Anand,7th April 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Another LCC in India, subsidiary of AirAsia. Service was ok, on time boarding and departure and so was arrival. Cabin crew were courteous but with respect to any other airline in India it has the least legroom, most congested seating configuration I found in India. This is one reason which makes me rethink before booking next flight with them.",no
AirAsia India,1,"""the staff was not cooperative""",Ankur Arora,7th April 2023,Not Verified |  AirAsia India is just pathetic. We were traveling in a group of 6 including an infant and on check-in the executive didn’t even bother to ask us or allocate the seats together as courtesy. All of us got separate seats and it was a nightmare to travel with a baby and no support from my family cause of these seats. Even some exemptions in the baggage allowance was close to nothing. Overall we felt the staff was not cooperative and the rules were way too stringent.,no
AirAsia India,1,"""Worst customer service""",S Jarmeer,7th April 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst customer service at Ranchi airport and this is the 3rd time, each time they create a unique bad experience with AirAsia at Ranchi. I saw them charging extra fee luggage, where couples were carrying with 14 kg cabined for checking. When I intervened they came with some random rules. But for sure will ensure I never use their service again",no
AirAsia India,1,"""had worst experience ever""",R Majesa,7th April 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked my Air Asia tickets for 2 Nov around 2 PM flight which got cancelled and rescheduled to different flight at 4.25 PM same day. At morning I received a call that new rescehuled flight delayed by 1 hour. After reaching to airport I again received a message that flight is delayed for 1 hour more and then it got delayed for more finally taking off at 9 PM and landing at 11.15 PM. So my 2.30 hour flight was actually 9 hours long. In airport AirAsia provided lunch which was only 5 spoons of biryani and there was no food provided in flight. Due to this I had to pay for lunch and for dinner and finally taking cab instead of metro. All of this increased my budget. So disappointed with Air Asia, No value of our time, had to pay more and my whole day and plans was compromised. Please avoid taking AirAsia, I with my family had worst experience ever.",no
AirAsia India,1,"""none of them had received calls""",N Barun,7th April 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have booked tickets for 6 people. 4 hours before the flight take off I received a call from AirAsia customer service that the flight is cancelled due to technical issue. I was asked to take the next day 5 am call. I told them I had already started my commute to airport and try to find an alternate flight for the same day. 10 minutes later I got a call again stating that the technical problem got resolved and I can use the same flight. When I enquired with some of the co-passengers to find out whether they received similar call from AirAsia, none of them had received calls like that.",no
AirAsia India,10,"""Thanks to his generous behaviour""",Amit Das,7th April 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Yesterday we travelled from Guwahati to Chennai, unfortunately at the last moment of check in there was a problem for which we were not allowed to check in.

AirAsia India,7,"""staff was good""",Kinshuk Kumar,29th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  The seats were comfortable, leather covers on the seats provided premium look and comfort. Leg room was low as per my height (5 10), staff was good and services were also good. Ground staff was helpful. Due to some reason i wasn't able to check in and book my seat, i requested on the counter he allotted me the seat although he requested for a positive feedback to be written.",yes
AirAsia India,10,"""It was a great experience""",Hashokmi Kamkara,29th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  The service of the head Airhostess Ms Kadoyee was very impressive, she was very Humble, understanding to all our grievances and explained in details about the various facilities and services in the flight. It was a great experience flying with AirAsia. Luggage arrangements and boarding was excellent. Personal care with senior citizen was a great sign of humanity and consideration. Thank you",yes
AirAsia India,1,"""Terrible experience with check in""",S Hanecas,29th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible experience with check in at Goa airport. I had paid for the much advertised Red Carpet service. There were only 2 counters open and both, (including one which was supposed to be red carpet) were crowded and disorderly. There was no premium feel and I had to go to the ordinary counter for baggage drop. Felt cheated for paying for a service that the airline could not offer and it appeared to be a way of fleecing customers. Check in staff were not sympathetic and did not care. Pathetic service. Will never travel by AirAsia India if there is a choice. To be fair to the airline, the only good experience was the hot and good food served on the flight.",no
AirAsia India,10,"""Awesome polite cabin crew""",D Jasana,29th September 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  Great fares. Excellent ground staff who calls you to let you know gate is closing. Awesome polite cabin crew. Comfortable seats. Excellent service. Good food.,yes

AirAsia India,2,"""Boarding was delayed by 30 min""",Pooja Bisht,29th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  From making a reservation first they canceled the morning flight, they shifted the passenger to afternoon flight. Boarding was delayed by 30 min. A small seat if someone is broad and and heavy weight.",no
AirAsia India,8,"""Overall a good flight""",R Vanush,29th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  On this flight as my travel agency had performed a group booking check in online was possible just couple of days before the flight. However when tried to print the baggage tags at the airport kiosks, I was unable to do so. The check in desks helped to drop the bag and I was pleased to note that during the boarding process, the staff was ensuring that people board as per their zones and this also helped prevent overcrowding during boarding. As the flight was a bit on the lighter side, the crew made me sit at an emergency exit row seat free of cost which was really great as the legroom was really good for a 2 hour 20 minute journey. The flight landed also on time and baggage retrieval was also swift. Overall a good flight. Appreciated the gesture of the crew allotting me an exit row seat.",yes
AirAsia India,1,"""my experience was not pleasant""",Ravi Chithajhallu,29th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vizag to Delhi and my experience was not pleasant. I booked international baggage and additional Baggage along with VIP for all 3 passengers. Other PNR only VIP. When I booked I had questions about baggage allowance showing 45kgs per passengers so called customer service (Twice) for clarification and suggestion for carrying 60kg per passenger. With the answers provided I was convinced and proceeded with the same. When i reached the airport at the check in counter the staff informed me that my luggage is overweight and i need to pay, initially i was trying to explain what's my understanding from customer service rep of airasia, immediately i was cut off by the line manager standing there in suit saying ""how can you believe customer service guys and you must know"". When I responded that i have call records he said ok lets play them now and listen to check in. When i was trying to play the record he again cut me off saying what exactly is my problem as i should be aware of baggage allowance policy and started laughing with his colleague. This was very insulting in front of my family as they felt very embarrassed to be treated like novice flyers. I responded saying I will deal with this later, let me get checked in and paid the extra money and while leaving the line manager along with other staff were murmuring and laughing. Soon one of the staff approached me, looking that we were upset, saying ""sir we will do what we can do to raise a service note of what happened here"" and apologised and left.",no
AirAsia India,9,"""thankful to them""",Saurav Kumar,29th September 2022,"Not Verified |  Due to some unexpected scenarios, I came to airport few mins before the flight time and boarding time was supposed to be much before that. I was about to miss my flight but the AirAsia team cooperated a lot and helped me board the flight which was very kind of them. I would be thankful to them. I hope this kind of service continues for all the different airline carriers also.",yes
AirAsia India,10,"""allow normal size sports equipment""",Madhavi Mishra,29th September 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  I’m glad Air Asia allowed my tennis racquets in the checking luggage without extra charges both ways Bangalore - Bhubaneswar. AirAsia’s policy to allow normal size sports equipment without extra charges is highly appreciated.,yes
AirAsia India,1,"""Will never choose it again""",Swati Pandey,26th June 2022,Not Verified |  Absolutely worse service. No customer care agent available to speak. My flight got cancelled because of some technical reasons by AirAsia India and i will get the refund amount after deducting 1000 rs from the total amount i paid. Regret to choose AirAsia India. Will never choose it again nor will refer it to anyone.,no
AirAsia India,1,"""we will not travel with you any more""",Chinmay Deshpande,26th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have taken flight with my family from Srinagar to Pune I5 737. Flight details was there will be 35 minutes halt at Delhi airport and Pune passenger will not be allowed to off board. When flight landed at Delhi air hostess announced that Pune passengers need to contact ground staff. We were total 8 Pune passengers which include kid of 2.5 yrs and senior citizens also. Ground staff told us that we have to off board and take another flight of AirAsia which will take off at 22.50 and handed us another ticket. The Srinagar flight landed at 22.20 then they take us from bus to exit and asked us to go from internal transfer with again all handbag checking. At ticket scanning the new tickets which they handed from that 2 tickets were not scanning and throwing some error in their system. So we have to wait there for 10 minute to get the clearance. After that ground staff was asking us to run till gate number 49 to get into another flight. With us as mention having senior citizens and also a kid, literally we had to run with all our hand bags. At gate 49 AirAsia person was saying to us that previous flight do not have that much of capacity. This is the worst management I have seen till now they are not aware about their flight capacity and asking passengers to take another flight in mid of journey. Thank you Air Asia for this pathetic experience and we will not travel with you any more.",no
AirAsia India,1,"""very serious concern about baggage""",N Tharkude,26th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I strongly recommend not to use AirAsia India. I have to raise a very serious concern about baggage. On 21st May we two families landed Srinagar at 1:30 pm, out of our 6 bags 1 bag was missing on the belt, upon asking they said bag was left behind for scanning it will come in next flight, after several follow up they delivered the bag to , me at hotel but the bag lock was tampered, bag got damaged for which I have sent email to nodal officer but the reply I got from them was asking age of the bag, invoice of the bag, that means they can do this by compensating by age of the bag which I have used only 3rd time.",no
AirAsia India,1,"""for the first time and now I really regret my decision""",K Laghari,26th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | I booked a flight from Delhi to Bangalore on 1/6/2022. I booked this ticket on 24/05/2022. Since I stay far away from the airport I choose the 9.30am flight. But on 27/05/2022 I got a message from AirAsia stating that they have cancelled my flight and they have re-accommodated me to another flight which is from Delhi to Visakhapatnam and Visakhapatnam to Bangalore but the problem was with the flight timing which is at 6.00am. If I need to get this flight I have to be at the airport by 4.00 am, which is impossible for me based on my location. I booked a premium ticket so I tried to change the date but I have to admit that I choose the wrong date in panic. Then I tried to cancel the ticket but the AirAsia agent told me that they can't refund the amount. It is their mistake for cancelling the flight and they won't refund for it. I usually prefer Indigo, I have never faced such problems but for a change I went with AirAsia for the first time and now I really regret my decision. I will never ever choose AirAsia again in my life time. This is opinion.",no
AirAsia India,1,"""Very disappointed with AirAsia India""",C Halchar,26th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had worst experience with Air Asia airlines today with flight from Delhi to Jaipur. At check-in unnecessary harassment to my 14year old, first with ID, not convinced with Aadhar card. I had to rush to give money he asked to pay as compensation, as my child's boarding had started. I had no option but to give money. Allowed luggage is 25kg, which I clarified twice before doing online check in, this guy says only 15kg. Now again pay money for extra luggage.  Very disappointed with AirAsia India.",no
AirAsia India,1,"!""I am done with AirAsia India""",Arunima Singh,26th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I want to highlight 2 pathetic experiences of AirAsia India here; One is the latest one wherein my younger sister was forced to miss her flight when no assistance was provided to her and she was held back by the staff till 2.30 when she had reached the airport at 2.05 PM. No one had helped her by escorting her through the security check. My sister is 18 years old and was travelling to Srinagar, AirForce Station to my sister, I purposely booked AirAsia, because I being a Tata employee prefer Tata products and services and also my sister being travelling for the first time alone, I took the leap of faith in AirAsia. However, rather than getting assistance she was stopped and held back by the staff of AirAsia itself which led to waste her time and missing her flight. When tried to negotiate with the staff they offered her to pay them 8000/- INR for the upcoming flight. I tried to speak to one of the executives over the phone and she rudely responded saying that drop an email, I can't help. I am done with AirAsia India and would definitely make sure for everyone around me.",no
AirAsia India,9,"""The crew were friendly and welcoming""",H Shavun,26th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had booked this flight a long time back in February so the fares were much cheaper. The web check-in process was smooth and it is observed that if one selects the default seats, they are free of cost however if one selects any other seat then a small fee needs to be paid. The bag drop was in terminal 1 of Mumbai airport which was done in a jiffy. Boarding started well ahead of time and the leather seats were good however for a taller person they might be slightly cramped. I was pleasantly surprised to know that I was entitled to a corporate meal as that was booked during the time of booking and so a small veg roll with some mango juice was provided on the flight which was quite good. The crew were friendly and welcoming during boarding / de-boarding. All in all a satisfactory flight.",yes
AirAsia India,1,"""This has been a terrible experience""",Sayandip Ghosh,26th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked an air ticket from the Air Asia website and paid with my MasterCard. A transaction fee was also deducted. When the flight was rescheduled, I opted for a refund. It was confirmed in the WhatsApp chat. The refund was processed on 12 Nov 2021. But the money was not received on my Card. I contacted them repeatedly regarding this issue, but every time I was informed that the money was paid from your end. I repeatedly had long queries at my bank. The bank checked everything and said no money was issued to my MasterCard. I have been contacting them for more than 2 months at least 10 times. No effort was made by them to refund. Only empty words. This has been a terrible experience for me.",no
AirAsia India,9,"""a very nice and unexpected touch""",S Shavun,26th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had booked tickets to Bangalore back in January where the fares were pretty reasonable. It was observed that during the online check in, once can do the process 12-14 days before the flight and also the default seat selection was free of charge which is well appreciated as other LCCs usually need the passenger to purchase the seat. The baggage drop was smooth process and the boarding also started on time and was greeted upon boarding by a crew member. The seats were comfortable enough however on longer flights this could be an issue where the seats might be cramped for someone on the taller side. The flight itself was uneventful however before landing, the crew distributed small perfume bottles which was a very nice and unexpected touch because in this era where airlines try to look for every opportunity to charge passengers, this gesture of providing free Titan perfumes was much appreciated. I would consider flying Air Asia India next time for the right price.",yes
AirAsia India,1,"""service offered were horrible""",M Maltafan,26th June 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience from AirAsia India as the service offered were horrible and non professional. They cancelled the direct flight a day before our journey and reschedule a long connection flight for travel without our consent which made us sit in the airport waiting area for 10 hours without any customer service from the airline.,no
AirAsia India,1,"""the worst airline you can board""",S Marpati,11th December 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Possibly the worst airline you can board. The staff is terrible and seems unpaid as rude behaviour reflects upfront. They will cool down the cabin temperature to below 18 degrees and then start renting out thin blankets for 400-500 rs. They change the gate frequently and wont send you any message. When you confront them, they will simply shrug their shoulders.  No words to define how low they can go to harass customers. Experience it on your own to know more. Do not opt for this airline. It may save you couple hundred bucks but will give you nightmares of life time.",no
AirAsia India,1,"""charge you for every ounce of luggage""",Y Hardikar,11th December 2021,✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible airline. Please don't waste your money by choosing to fly with them. They will charge you for every ounce of luggage including laptops. Do not recommend them ever,no
AirAsia India,1,"""the refund amount is low""",Snehitha Vundi,11th December 2021,Not Verified |  I recently booked flight tickets for me and my family to fly from Hyderabad to Bangalore. But due to the bad weather condition in Bangalore and due to the heavy rains I decided to off my journey and when I decided to cancel all of my tickets the airline showed me a refund amount of not even 10% of the amount I paid. I can say that it is the worst airline ever. I not even showed up and I am cancelling it far more than 24 hours but still the refund amount is low where I felt very bad.,no
AirAsia India,1,"""never recommend AirAsia India""",Nilesh Singh,11th December 2021,✅ Trip Verified |  It was a early morning flight and I was unable to do web checkin. I approach to the AirAsia desk and staff was totally unprofessional. She just ignored and start attending the other customers. After waiting for a while she just walked out from the window. I will never recommend AirAsia India. Horrible ground staff.,no
AirAsia India,8,"""seat pitch is something that needs to be kept in mind""",V Agarwal,11th December 2021,"✅ Trip Verified | After a long time, I had decided to fly back to Bangalore on Air Asia on this afternoon flight as the timing was convenient for the arrival. A point to note is that the check in for the flight has opened almost 2 weeks before the departure of the flight as opposed to the usual 48 hours which is present on the other flights. Also another point to note is that the default seat selection which is provided by Air Asia seems to be free of cost, however if we try to change our seating rows, then a charge of Rs 250 needs to be provided for the window / aisle seats. As me and my wife were travelling together, I had decided to go with the default seat selection so as to avoid the extra seat fares. During the check-in the staff was proactive enough to accommodate me and my wife in a separate line which was faster than the usual long queues present. Also the crew wanted us to provide a feedback on the check-in process and how it could be improved and this was a pretty fun thing that was done. Boarding started well on time and one thing to note is that, if you are a person on the taller side, the seats could be a bit cramped. I have flown on other low cost carriers and Air Asia seems by far the most cramped when it comes to seat pitch. On short haul flights they are fine however on flights of more than 2 hours it could get uncomfortable. Also during boarding, I did not see the crew welcoming everyone on board which is something that was surprising considering how well the staff at the check in counters were. Flight landed well ahead of schedule and baggage was also retrieved quickly. For the money that was paid, the service provided was nice. However seat pitch is something that needs to be kept in mind.",yes
AirAsia India,1,"""wait in Pune airport for 7 hrs""",Deeksha Rajpoot,11th December 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked our flights for 21st sep 2021 from BBI>DEL,& on 28th sep 2021 from DEL>BBI (direct flights ,no stop-over) in advance on 13th August 2021 so that we did not suffer by anything. Today we received a notification that our direct flight is going to be connecting now from BBI>PNQ>DEL (with almost 7 hour of halt in PNQ). Now my elderly parents have to wait in Pune airport for 7 hrs which making me furious. You are not able to give me earlier or later (+- 2,day flexibility) flight because you do not have any direct flight so its none of my problem. I purchase for some service and I deserve the same.",no
AirAsia India,8,"""overall flight went well""",V Purna,11th December 2021,"Not Verified |  The AirAsia airline was pretty good. My height is 183cm even then I felt comfortable with the leg space. The airhostess were very polite and helpful they changed the seats too, those are willing to change there seat can change and he arranged the passengers who are sitting in middle seats to window or side corner seats and it was in budget. Tthe ground staff were also good but not so good in politeness But overall flight went well.",yes
AirAsia India,1,"""insisted on redistributing the luggage""",Divya Garg,11th December 2021,✅ Trip Verified |  There were 3 passengers (including a kid of 2 years) and 3 cabin bags. Total weight of 3 bags was less than 21 kgs. It was just that one bag was 8kg and others very light. So it should not have been an issue. But airline staff insisted on redistributing the luggage among bags. I see no point in doing that.,no
AirAsia India,1,"""received my refund after 6 weeks""",K Khan,11th December 2021,"Not Verified |  Made an online booking since the fares were cheaper than others. To be fair to them the flight crew were helpful and attentive on the outward journey. The return flight was cancellede. We were promised a refund.

After much follow up and constantly asking received my refund after 6 weeks.",no

It was my 15th Yr wedding anniversary and I wanted to make it special for my wife. So, I checked with the cabin crew if they could do something special for the occasion and they immediately obliged and made a special announcement wishing myself and my wife and the entire cabin crew came and wished us and sang for us which was amazing.

Selected the flight due to least trouble of not changing the plane at Delhi and paid extra fare for seat selection. It was good till we landed at Delhi.

As my check in baggage weight exceeded the 15kg free allowance as I had extra luggage packed, I was made to pay around 375 Rs for every extra kg and the staff there were generous enough to waive off 1 kg extra in exchange for a South Indian breakfast on the flight which was reasonable enough. The boarding started on time and there was some nice funky boarding music being played and the seats were comfortable enough although on longer duration trips, it could be uncomfortable. The flight departed on time and even though the flight was full, the crew were very nice and after takeoff I even got the South Indian breakfast which consisted of an idli, medu vada with sambhaar and upma. The meal was decent enough although if one has to purchase this directly in-flight, it was quite pricey at around 350 INR and maybe the quantity does not justify the price. But then again, low cost carriers aren't exactly known for being generous when it comes to inflight food and beverages. Landing was on time and retrieval of the baggage was also swift. I would say that the flight was quite nice and even though low cost carriers try to maximize revenue through ancillary services (meals / excess baggage) they provide the best functional experience when it comes to taking you from point A to point B. And Air Asia does that pretty well. I cannot think of any area which was lacking on this flight. Keep it up.",yes

But 2 of our members were not present so total 80kg baggage allowance was allowed. Thats okay I can understand this. Then next the guy told us to make 20kg according to the pnrs. He was not ready to consider both bookings simultaneously. . One of our group member doesn't have last name so booking was like First name and staff there was not ready to allow us to board. One of their staff was talking in a very rude way. Then we moved to airline's next boarding pass check station.

The boarding pass print and check in of the baggage was performed at the designated points. Boarding was slightly delayed and as a result of which we ended up being delayed by over 20 minutes. The seats inside the Airbus were comfortable enough although it could be uncomfortable for longer flights. Seat pitch was comfortable at 30 inches and for someone who is 5'10 it was okay. The crew were very proactive and good. I observed that the crew even provided infant seat belts and snack items. We landed at Delhi around 20-25 minutes behind schedule and the baggage collecting took some time on the coveyor belt.

The scheduled departure was 0025 hours, but we departed as early as around 0015 hours when all the passengers had boarded. Though the scheduled arrival at Pune was at 0200 hours, we had landed by 0130 hours, and that half-an-hour early arrival at the destination delighted me. I found the seats respectably comfortable with decent leg-room. Personally I'd have preferred if the seats could recline a little more backward as it was a red-eye flight. And the price of food came as a disappointment, but that's pretty much the case with any other low-cost carrier.",yes
AirAsia India,1,"""never to travel via Air Asia again""",Arpit Narang,20th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Goa to Delhi. My experience with Air Asia was terrible. I had booked a flight which was supposed to take off at 7:25pm with flight duration of 2.5 hours. It got delayed and took off at 9pm. When we land, we got to know that the flight had landed in Jaipur instead of New Delhi due to shortage of fuel. No information or clarity is being given by the crew on the take off schedule. It has been more than 30 minutes of waiting inside the airplane without any service for water or proper air conditioning in the plane. The crew shows no concern for the customers. We still don't know when will we be reaching our destination. This experience has given me a lesson never to travel via Air Asia again.",no

We get there on time for the original takeoff and we are received by belligerent employees. They have no clue about what is to follow and are passing that irritation on to us.

At the airport I again asked AirAsia about getting us in a row as a family travelling together. They refused and said they can't do this without additional money.

AirIndia,1,"""the experience was extremely poor""",Joshua Heath,26th September 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew from Sydney to Delhi on flight AI301 and the experience was extremely poor, unacceptable service from the onboard crew throughout the flight. Before take off a ground crew member came onboard to inform me the entertainment system at my seat was not working. I was given the following 3 options: Option #1 They would try and get me on a flight the next day. I was traveling for business with multiple meetings booked for my arrival in Delhi which could not be changed. I declined this offer. Option #2 downgrade to economy. I declined this offer. Option #3 sign a form giving me Rs 10,000 credit, approximately $180AUD. I accepted this offer however considering my flight was 12 hours with no entertainment the compensation offered was extremely disappointing, inadequate and not reflective of the situation I was faced with. The most shocking part of the flight which was completely inappropriate were the crew members that took their sleep breaks in seat E & F of row 1 business class seats. In total I counted 6 different crew taking their sleep breaks for around 45min - 1hour with some even changing into sleepwear. Absolutely appalling! I did not pay a full business class fare to be seated in a crew rest area, unexceptionable and disgraceful. At what stage of air travel did crew sleep in passenger seats let alone in business class. Throughout my flight it was exceedingly difficult to get a crew members attention, even after pressing my call button crew would walk straight pass my seat which I witnessed this among other passengers as well. I had to get up from me seat twice during my flight to go and ask a crew member in the galley for assistance. Non of the crew were helpful or polite and I was made to feel like I was an inconvenience to their journey. I contact Air India via email following my flight regarding the crew taking their rest breaks in the Business Class cabin, astonishingly I was informed that “crew are permitted to rest in vacant seats”. So unless you want to sit next to the crew taking it their rest breaks I recommend avoiding Air India.",no

I am now 24 days latter, after 10's of calls and several tickets opened still not in the possesion of my luggage. Air India knows nothing, all they suggest is rasing another ticket. As the others I already have are closed. Not that anyone even contacted me once to tell me something. The sheer incompetence of this airline is incredible. I will take a moment here also to speak about the flight itself: aircraft dirty, not a little dirty but dirty in a gross way, like it was cleaned the last time a few years ago. Entertainment wise, 50% of all screens in the aircraft were not working, the ones that did had headphones issues, the perfect environment to spend 9h. This was the last time that I will buy a ticket from them and I really advice everyone else to not look at a couple of dollars difference and save yourselves hours of headaches. Customer support is inexistant, they answer, they barely speak english and all that they do is open tickets that they close themselves probably to look good in statistics as none of my tickets got any answer, or at least an automatic email saying that your ticket is closed. You just wait like an idiot and nothing happens.",no

I choose the hassle free itinerary so that he doesn't have to check in the baggage two times but the opposite happened. While booking the ticket the airline hid the information about baggage self transfer in the transit and I confirmed with their costumer service agent two times that if the connected flight will have automatic baggage check in or else and both time I got the answer that this is same airline in both flights so it is automatically transfer baggage service. So I was relieved but at Delhi airport my father was told to take the baggage and self check in again and he was confused and called me to confirm. As of my surprise I called the air india customer support which was of no help obviously. Finally my father who is almost 65 years has to self check in the baggage.

Insult to injury was that the flight attendants did not care about it and no effort was made to comfort the passengers. Somehow they expected us to accept it. Seats are broken.

The airline kept on changing the time without any notice. My initial layover was five hours at airport which eventually led a twelve hour stay in an airport. Once I reached my destination and contacted the customer care, they wouldn’t help me out with the whole thing, instead they said they will contact me back vey soon. Till this day they haven’t. This is not the first time I’m facing the same issue. From my experience never choose Air India, the service is just getting worse and worse. No sense of customer satisfaction or helping them. To say the airport staff are just communalists. Even though they know a person don’t know Hindi they just keep forcing and shoving Hindi on to your face. I have called the customer service more than five times still these company does not give a damn about there passengers. Flying on Air India is just useless and you won’t be able to reach your destination on time. If anyone need to reach a destination on time go for a different flight.

Before boarding she was told that her seat is upgraded to 5 A in business class as she has high value ticket during booking. After boarding in 5 A seat, ground staff came inside the flight and asked her to shift to 18 C economy, by providing a new boarding pass. It was near to lavatory, already she was feeling nauseating, so she asked details of why it is changed after seating in seat, she was told this changes happen, and she was denied to even seat on her originally booked ticket of 17 C economy.  And ultimately she had to seat at a broken seat 10 k in business class, to avoid nausea and seat next to lavatory. It was basically a selection between backache due to broken seat and nausea due to close to lavatory. Cabin crew rajkumar and dimpy went out of their way to make her feel comfortable, But she developed backache after seating in broken seat. And crew of flight told to complain against the ground staff lady.

No idea how this airline can be part of Star Alliance with their standard being so far behind. Almost all entertainment screens were broken - dirty floor and seats with stains - no water or toilet paper in the toilets - horrible food especially for people who can't handle spicy or lentils well - seats in A320 ridiculously close to each other, got constantly slammed by the guy in front of me. This felt even worse than Ryanair but they're at least cheap, also there was no entertainment on 4hr flight - security at Delhi Airport steals your vape and lighter even if you just transit but let's you pass with a custom half liter bottle with an unknown substance? I have no understanding for this behaviour at all, Security also was unfriendly and arrogant. Absurdly high fees for change of flight data if ticket not eligible for online change (360€ for 1 day later), might be like this with other carriers as well but I don't like it. Actually the only good thing I can say is that you can take 2 big suitcases while Air France, KLM, Lufthansa ... try to rip you off here and offer long distance flight fares even without any luggage which messes up the results of flight search engines.

Apart from this the aircraft had a bad odor which made me uncomfortable. For the rest of the flight, I faced no issue and the food was good along with the cheerful cabin crew, but my bad opinion on Air India further increased when the flight landed in Delhi, it took almost 30-40 mins of waiting in the aircraft just to deplane after the plane came to a complete stop because of improper communication which lead to a lot of unrest among the passengers leading to a chaotic deplaning experience.

AirIndia,1,"""never fly Air India again""",J McCarthy,19th July 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |  SYD-DEL-CPH-DEL-SYD: on each of these 4 legs we had no light, no call button, no entertainment and no apology. Leaving Sydney, we waited on the ground for 2 hours as people in hi-viz kept walking on and off the plane wearing worried expressions. The announcement from the flight deck was garbled but we understood the words 'technical issues'. By the time we arrived in New Delhi it was so late there was no slot for landing so we ended up in the cargo area and had to take a bus to the terminal. When we got on the plane in Delhi to return to Sydney we waited 10 minutes after scheduled take-off to receive the first piece of information from the flight deck: 'technical issues ... safety' and we were deplaned. 90 minutes in Delhi airport until a new plane could be organised. Then full security check again. We were compensated with warm water or juice box. But better to be deplaned on the ground than in the air. And, once again, no light, no call button, no entertainment and no apology. Generally the staff were good on the four legs - though conspicuously absent during the shambles of deplaning. Food too was OK, but difficult to muck up a veg curry. Needless to say, we will never fly Air India again.",no

At the time of flying, Air India had not yet extended the cabin refresh to the aircraft type I flew, but the plane overall was clean and there were no maintenance issues onboard. Food was great as always. Communication could have been improved, especially since foreign mobile phones are blocked in Ladakh and there is no public WiFi in Kushok Bakula Rimpoche Airport, we were unable to receive delay alerts directly from Air India and had to rely on the screens and announcements which were updated at a pretty leisurely pace. The company is still not consistently enforcing an orderly boarding process, but aside from those two things the vast majority of the issues I had were not the airline's fault.

Who's fault is this then that I missed my International flight that I paid around 3K CAD for? Not only that I had to book a new flight again that costed me around 3K CAD and because it was last minute booking the airline couldn't offer me vegetarian meal.

Not sure if it is the system they use or staff having difficulty to use their system, the process of check in baggage is very very slow. I was stuck with a very stern officer who took considerable time checking each and every boarding pass more than the usual time and when I had to go to the cashier she refused to accept and sent me to another end of the terminal for payment.

I ended up paying more than stated due to lack of information provided by the airline. I have had the worst experience with Air India. When landed initially, they misplaced my checked baggage which I received after 20 days of my arrival in India and then at the time of departure, they lied to us relating to the baggage fees.

Another horrible thing that the manager was confused about required documents, not cooperative at all and was demanding unnecessary documentation like DG shipping B1 visa (such a document does not exist). I was denied to get boarding pass and it took almost 1 hour to convince him that B1/B2 are USA tourists visas and seafarers joining ships required only C1/D visa.

Once boarded, we were served a vegetarian roll. Said they are having catering issues and only boxed items are available. No notification regarding same was given to us until boarded the flight. Later came food in boxes with Vistara label (a sandwich, Haldiram packet, chocolate, granola bar). Vistara label is indicative that the airline was aware of the issue earlier. Why passengers were not notified either by email/SMS. No beverages were served. Had to ask for a coffee. Also had to ask the hostess to have the cup removed after 45 min. Lacking basic standards of customer service. Towards the end of trip, head of crew came to apologize for the catering issue. Return trip on 5/12 was in Economy class. No blankets were provided at seat. Audio-Visual system never worked. Should say there was food.

The Vistara label on the box indicate that they had prior knowledge about the catering issue and contained a soggy veg sandwich a chocolate and cookie for a 15 hr non-stop flight. The crew’s attitude was even embarrassing and no one even bothered to take the coffee cup back and it was done after a request was made and it took them 90 minutes to take the cup.

AirIndia,1,“poor management and bad decisions”,O Shaw,17th May 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | The Airline was on a downhill spiral since almost 16 years if not more. When the Tata's took over people had high hope for its recovery. However even after 28 months things are as bad if not worse. I avoid flying this airline and rarely do unless I have no better options. It's a big let down for a Tata company. I do not know if there is any other business in this group that is anywhere even close to as bad as Air India is now. I also feel one reason the airline cannot improve is due to the guy at the top Campbell Wilson. This guy has a lot of management experience but most is for a budget airline and he is trying to run it in that manner. Just a recent example is the reduction of baggage allowance for domestic flights to 16 kgs for Economy passengers. This guy says this is in line with the industry trend. Well I don't think so unless he is comparing with the budget airlines. Even Japan Airlines offers 2x 23 kgs on its domestic flights. So what is the difference between AI and the other budget airlines, offering the same 15 kgs. In my recent case they advanced the timing of my flight which did not suit me as it did not give me enough time to connect with my Inbound flight from Tokyo. I called and pleaded that the new timing will not suit me and therefore I wish to cancel. I was told that I can cancel but there will be no refund. I have never had issues with their Star Alliance partner airlines when they change flight timings and I get a full refund in case of cancellation. Not only Star Alliance but numerous airlines with One World and Sky Team offer a full refund if new flight timings do not suit. Obviously this is another similarity with Budget Airlines. I definitely cannot recommend this airline in it's current avatar unless there is a drastic change which I do not see happening any time soon, definitely not under a CEO who is trying to run it as a budget airline. I also understand that the airline is currently at a loss. However with poor management and bad decisions they are losing further loyalty.",no
AirIndia,1,""" disaster from start to finish""",R Parjun,17th May 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |  My recent experience with Air India on a long-haul flight from Melbourne to Hyderabad was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, the journey was marred by a series of disappointments and discomforts that left me deeply dissatisfied.  The food served was not only of poor quality, but it was also presented in a manner that suggested utter disregard for basic hygiene standards. Packages were not just messy inside but also had spills all over the exterior, making the already unappetizing meals even less appealing. To add insult to injury, the taste was abysmal, and the quality of desserts was subpar, failing to meet even the most basic expectations. Moving on to the condition of the aircraft itself, the state of the toilets was deplorable. Broken toilet doors and malfunctioning facilities resulted in a pervasive stench that permeated the seating area, creating an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere for passengers. It's unacceptable to subject paying customers to such unsanitary conditions. Furthermore, the lack of inflight entertainment for a significant portion of the seats is simply inexcusable in this day and age. With technology readily available, there's no reason why passengers should be deprived of this basic amenity, especially during a lengthy 20-hour flight. Speaking of discomfort, the seating arrangements were far from satisfactory. Uncomfortable seats made the already arduous journey even more taxing, leaving passengers feeling physically strained and restless. And if the in-flight experience wasn't bad enough, the ordeal continued upon arrival at Delhi airport. The mishandling of baggage collection, with staff carelessly pulling out bags from the belt and haphazardly placing them outside, created chaos and confusion among passengers trying to locate their belongings. In conclusion, my experience with Air India was nothing short of a disaster from start to finish. The combination of poor food quality, unsanitary conditions, lack of entertainment, uncomfortable seating, and chaotic baggage handling has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with them again. It's truly disappointing to see such a renowned airline fall so far below acceptable standards, and I urge prospective passengers to think twice before considering Air India for their travels.",no

On the second leg, the in-flight entertainment remote was taped to the armrest because it too was broken. There is one little USB to try and charge gadgets not robust enough for my laptop. Oh, and the recline didn’t work either. For fifteen hours. Regardless, the economy seat backs are about 2 inches of hard plastic coated in musty fabric. Zero padding to be found. For fifteen hours. The extra 1” of legroom when compared to US carries doesn’t add much to the experience I’ve got to say.

They falsely claimed that EL AL had canceled their part of the flight, when in reality, they hadn't. This deceitful behavior only added to the frustration of the situation. Their failure to provide an alternative flight after canceling mine, as required by law, further compounded the issue.

Well, more than uncertain. When we boarded the plane, the cabin was heated to around 35°, which remained the case for the first 1.5 hours or so of the flight.  The seatbelt indicator lights did not work either. This perceived safety problem was compounded by the overall condition of the aircraft. While the entertainment system at my wife's seat didn't work on the outward flight, it practically failed throughout the entire plane on the return flight. And that on a long-haul flight. In addition, one toilet didn't work, my seat back was in a catastrophic state and one toilet was out of order. In another, the washbasin was provisionally glued down so that it didn't fall off the wall. Do you feel comfortable and safe? A clear no. It's also cheeky: when checking in online 48 hours before departure, the seats are displayed. Our two seats offered at no extra cost were in different rows. If we wanted to sit together or enjoy a bit more legroom, we had to pay extra. Coincidentally, relatives of ours were flying from Frankfurt to Singapore the same week.

Whenever I requested assistance from the flight attendants, their standard reply was, “We’ll take care of it for your side later.” Unfortunately, these assurances rarely translated into action. Whether it was headphones, desserts, or other amenities, the promised items often failed to materialize. Strongly urge the management to implement better checks and balances.

In trying to read, I had to catch the attention of a flight attendant who passed by. She had to turn it on via the wall mount behind the crew seat for me. The same happened when I wanted to have the light turned off. It was a dilapidated aircraft in need of refurbishment. The 12.5 hour flight felt very long, as there was no IFE.

Also like the fact that after the flight, I was surprised the flight attendant did not collect the food trays in order. She collected them in her own order.

There were so many big issues that I am writing this review so you do not have to go through the same thing I did. Too crowded and unhygienic.  For a flight of 12 hours we did not anything to entertain because the screen for almost half of flight was not working. Flights was delayed for almost 3 hours with no transparent information and from the beginning the delay time was 20 minutes which added up to almost 3 hours. Due to delay we lost our next flight which was also via air India and the staff at Delhi airport tried every possible way to make us find our own accommodation and even asked us to lie at Indian immigration parrotting us to tell we want to visit Delhi not the real reason that we had to get out as they couldn’t provide us accommodation within the airport premises which ended up creating a discussion and kind of scene.

After the changes, we were finally boarded on a different flight departing Monday afternoon, 2 days later. All during this time, Air India didn't offer any kind of compensation; no meals, no lodging, no nothing. We had to stay at a hotel 2 nights at our own expense.

They wrote back ""In the case of your booking to SFO we humbly convey to you that you were given alternate flight and that you travelled till your final destination"".

This has been such a common complaint from my relatives hence they warned me. I pressed the call attendant button but they would just turn off the sign. I pressed the button 4 times and on all 4 occasions they turned off the sign from their end. Frustrated I went to cabin crew area where they were just talking. I dont have any issues with them laughing and talking , it is their right. My problem is why they kept turning off the help calls? I explained that the inflight entertainment did not work. They asked me to sit. 5 mins later, a lady came and said its a common issue and the fact that the flight is around 8 hours, I could sleep during this time. I told her yes I would sleep but no one should be commanding what time I do what. She said maybe I can give feedback as none of Air India inflight entertainment systems work in any plane.",no
AirIndia,1,"""I asked for compensation""",Sven Olsson,3rd March 2024,✅ Trip Verified |  The airline is part of the Star Alliance but is not an airline that lives up to the normal standard. The plane was supposed to have inflight entertainment but the majority of the screens were not working. Might be a problem in one plane but as it was the same on both flights it is most probably a systematic problem. Please prepare to have your own entertainment with you. The food onboard was really bad (normally I like the kind of food served in India but this was really bad). Take something to eat with you if you are foolish enough to go by Air india. The plane was dirty and even though the space was fairly good I would warn you for the not so pleasant flight. Service was ok but the limits of all type of drinks was not good (I only drink nonalcoholic and still there was limits). My travel was delayed by almost 5 hours and that was according to the staff on the ground due to technical problems at first and then after finding an alternative plane they needed another crew as the other had to many hours.

AirIndia,1,"""Our worst flying experience""",D Haysan,3rd March 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our worst flying experience. My wife and I were flying Air India from Ahmedabad to Newark via Mumbai. Our first flight was delayed (from 8:25 pm to 9:25pm) and we were informed just a few hours before. After arriving at the airport, we were told that our connecting flight form Mumbai to Newark has been cancelled and that we would have to fly to JFK in NY instead. We insisted that we would prefer to fly to Newark but no one could guarantee us a seat to Newark even a few days later. We were told no flight could be seen in the near future and that we should take the flight to JFK. Well, the flight from Ahmedabad was not delayed by an hour, it did not depart for another hour and a half (@ 11 pm). By then, we had been at the airport for 5 hours but no one offered us any food vouchers or water. After arriving in Mumbai, we had a heck of a time getting to the gate due to the distance and security check, etc. The flight to JFK was scheduled at 1:45 am and we were sure we couldn’t make that! Even worse than that is the fact that while we were trying to reach our gate, we heard an announcement for an Air India flight leaving for Newark!!! We were lied to about the Newark flight being cancelled and bumped onto another flight which reaches at an airport that is another hour away form Newark. We did not receive any prior notification as with the first flight but were surprised at the check-in counter. Meanwhile, the flight to JFK was delayed by a little over an hour and finally left at 3:00 am with us on it. We had to make other arrangements to get home and it cost us more money!!

Was on the Toronto to Delhi direct flight and got a swift realization why I will never book to fly with Air India again. I was flying with 3 others that all needed special wheelchair assistance, so in order to even check-in we had to wait in line first before they would even allow them to sit in the wheelchair area. Now up to this point everything was a mild inconvenience. However the flight itself was what made sealed the deal of never flying Air India. For a direct long haul flight I cannot believe the condition of the airplane. The upholstery was dirty and falling apart held together with zip ties. The bathrooms were disgusting and also falling apart. The icing on the cake was a 13.5 hr flight with no inflight entertainment and being told they cannot fix it.

AirIndia,1,"""A very bad experience""",Akshay Jain,2nd February 2024,"Not Verified |  A very bad experience. It was a 12.5 hr flight from Delhi to Sydney. Supposed to take off at 2:15pm on 13th Jan from Delhi. Firstly I reach the check in Counter at 11:45 am and stood in the queue. There are so many counters for air India but any counter is not for a particular air India flight which males is so difficult for passengers as almost every passenger is asking the staff is this line for Sydney or Dubai or London or xyz destination. Secondly there were so long queue that by the time I reached the actual counter 1hr and 15 mins have already passed by. So finally at 1pm I reached the counter and handed my passport to the staff so they can check in and initiate a baggage drop. While the staff was checking my flight details I just got an sms that my flight has been delayed by 2 hrs and will now take off at 4:30 pm instead of 2:15 pm . Then the staff had a look and told me since your flight is now delayed to 4:30pm we cannot check you in you are too early for the flight, go and rest and come back in 1 hr and we should be able to check you in. So which means I had already waster 1hr and 15 mins in the queue then the flight is delayed by 2 hrs; after that I have to wait for another 1hr then stand in line again and then check in my luggage. What a waste of time. 1hr later at roughly around 2:15 pm I went to the counter again to check and she said your check in was already open about 2 hrs ago and that the person you spoke to earlier had given wrong information. Finally I did a baggage drop and went further for a security check. After security we went and waited for boarding as now the boarding was only going to happen at 4pm I still had another 1 hr with nothing to do. I had thought I will be in flight already 2:15 they would give food but now the flight is late by 2 hrs so no food for another 2 hrs and they did not compensate us with any complimentary food at the airport either. Slowly some time passed by and at 3:45 there was another announcement that the flight is now further delayed to a 5:30 take off. This meant that there has been a 3 hr delay from the original scheduled time of take off. Then at 4:45 finally they started the boarding so finally I had some relief and thought ok no more delays now . Almost everyone was seated in the flight and at 5:15 i heard another announcement that they are waiting for 1 passe ger as they have not yet boarded the flight. 10 minutes the passenger finally came. The flight finally started a take off at 5:45 pm. After all this once the flight was in the air around 6:15 pm they made an announcement that the seat belt sign is off and they provide snacks in some time. Finally at 6:45 they provided snacks and drinks.  Also from the time I sat in the plan the TV was not working at all. I informed them and they said they are serving food so they will do a reset after they finish with the food. They started serving food at 6:45 pm and finished by 7:45 pm . I told then again about the TV and they said they will go and reset now and it would then take 20 minutes to reset and come back up. So I thought probably by 8:15 at least I should be able to watch something . Once the reset was completed and I turned on the TV but still it was not fixed. Basically I had to stay for the entire 13 hrs flight without TV. I had no option left but go to sleep. first long wait for check in ; second flight delayed by 3 hrs and third no TV",no

Our luggage was lost with no support or communication from the airline. The lack of empathy and remorse in the way customers were treated is unacceptable. Seeking assistance from a supervisor resulted in extra-long wait times, only to be met with dismissive attitudes. Holding a grudge for asking for help is not the kind of service one expects. I had essential medication in my suitcase, and despite carrying only a 2-day supply in my hand luggage, the lost baggage left me in a dire situation. It's now day 3, and there's still no news on the baggage. Additionally, there's been no communication regarding a claim or compensation for the inconvenience caused. The airline changed/cancelled my flight without any prior notification, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience.  When faced with a modified flight, I had no flexibility and was forced to choose their option. Exploring alternatives was impractical due to last-minute expenses from other airlines and the urgency of an expiring visa the next day.

Honestly, I had a very pleasant experience. The check in process, baggage handling, comfort, boarding, cleanliness, ground and cabin crew, food and service were all excellent - on par with what you'd usually expect with the likes of Singapore Airlines. Crew member Pranali on MEL-DEL flight on 12 Jan was particularly kind, attentive and excellent at her job. Honestly I'd fly this airline again.

But for my backup on my phone, it would have been an excruciating 15 hours to Delhi which the passenger next to me endured. Of the three meals served, two were almost the same. The caterer or the menu designer have to be changed immediately so that the passengers are not fed almost identical ill-prepared meals in quick succession.

AirIndia,1,"""attempting to profit $700 from me""",Christian Metcalf,5th December 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight from JFK to Kathmandu for February of 2024 in October 2023, but unfortunately had to cancel the flight within 24 hours and book via another airline. When I cancelled, I received a cancellation confirmation email from Air India confirm the flight was cancelled and I would receive a 100% refund for cancelling in a timely manner. However, two weeks later, I had not received any refund. I reached out to Air India's customer service and they insisted I never cancelled the flight. I was passed between multiple representatives and finally told to create a Case. I did so, including all documentation, and followed up with Air India two more times. The second time, a representative confirmed I would receive a 100% refund within 24 hours. No refund ever came - I followed up multiple times, and never received any further responses other than insisting I cancel myself via their online portal, which would cost me $700 for a bogus cancellation fee. I did nothing wrong in this scenario, and yet Air India is attempting to profit $700 from me, in nothing less than criminal fashion.",no

AirIndia,10,“they have done a commendable job”,Puja Bhowmick,5th December 2023,Not Verified |  I took a domestic flight from Agartala to Kolkata for my international travel the same day and I was solo travelling with a 15 month old baby. I was slightly worried or had my anticipations for how things will go. But the staff had done a marvellous job up make my trip as comfortable as it can get. Specially “Mr. Avishek Dhar” helped me a lot by managing my luggage to make it through travel till JFK so that I have a comfortable trip with the baby. Also baggage allowance for international flight was allowed in domestic flight according to Air India policy. All in all they have done a commendable job to make me go stress free the whole trip.

AirIndia,2,“experience with Air India was challenging”,Bhawana Thaker,5th December 2023,"Not Verified |  My experience with Air India was challenging due to the itinerary and service encountered during the journey. The flights had extended layovers – a 4-5 hour stopover in Delhi on the way to Hyderabad and an 11-hour stopover in Mumbai on the return journey to New Jersey. This lengthy wait was quite arduous and left a lasting impression. Regarding the in-flight service, it was satisfactory, although the food served from Mumbai to EWR lacked authenticity and didn't meet expectations. At Delhi airport, I was pleasantly surprised by its cleanliness and modern infrastructure. However, there was a noticeable struggle to maintain cleanliness due to some individuals littering, which affected the overall ambiance. On the other hand, Mumbai airport was extremely crowded, and I faced challenges with uncooperative staff. Despite my long-haul flight, 11-hour stopover, and having a sick child with me, both immigration officers and Air India staff were unhelpful and showed reluctance. Their lack of empathy was evident, with one supervisor even making a disparaging comment suggesting I 'try my luck' with immigration. This was a disappointing and rude response. I strongly urge Air India's customer-facing staff to undergo training in empathy and kindness. As a business class passenger, enduring an 11-hour layover with unhelpful staff was a significant inconvenience and a negative experience. I rate my experience a 2 out of 10 specifically due to the unhelpful and rude behavior encountered with Air India staff at Mumbai airport. Such attitudes are unacceptable when dealing with customers who expect better service standards.",no

To my pleasant surprise I did manage to get an aisle seat located at the front which was good. Boarding was on time and for breakfast I had opted for the veg option which consisted of some stuffed parathas, chole, a croissant along with coffee. The crew were quite nice and soothing and the flight itself landed uneventfully without any issues at its destination.",yes
AirIndia,1,"""experience was much worse than ever before""",Mercy Manjaly,21st November 2023,"Not Verified |  My Mother passed away May 21, 2023. I booked an Air India flight to travel May 21, 2023 from SFO to COK to attend her funeral. My family scheduled her funeral accordingly so I could attend the funeral. I was supposed to land in Kerala May 23rd at 0700 a.m. in plenty of time to attend her funeral the same day at 3pm. My mother’s house is just 30 minutes from the airport, and I would have plenty of time to reach home a few hours before the funeral. But unfortunately, I couldn’t attend the funeral because the Air India flight was delayed at SFO for several hours causing me to miss the layover flight to go to Kerala. I explained my emergency to everyone who were responsible, but the Air India staff didn’t care about it and rescheduled a flight that wouldn’t reach Kerala until 7pm causing me to miss my mother’s funeral. It is important in my culture and religious belief to be present for the funeral and events following. How can I ever reconcile this situation in my life in my heart? The traumatic experience I had with flying Air India and missing of my mother’s funeral is still difficult to come to terms with. It took me a long time to even write my experience in this portal. Unfortunately, this wasn’t an isolated example of poor service on this flight. On return to SFO the luggage was delayed 2.5 hours! We were given the reason for the delay as “there was no baggage workers to take the bags off the plain.” Not only was my time wasted but my transportation home was waiting for almost three hours. This is completely unacceptable. I have been a frequent international flyer for years, on many different airlines, and I was expecting a much better experience with Air India since TATA took over. Disappointedly, my experience was much worse than ever before. I was shocked to realize that Air India doesn’t have a suitable plan to deal with emergency situations like this. Air India will not be an airline of consideration for future travels because I don’t trust their reliability getting me to my destination for important life events. I feel like Air India doubled my traumatic experience, my mother passing compounded by not attending the funeral. This is a regret that I must live with for the rest of my life.",no

AirIndia,8,“the soft product was markedly improved”,V Reddy,21st November 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I had booked initially on economy class for this flight but was able to upgrade to business as there were a couple of seats available which came at a fee and I really wanted to see how things have changed especially on the business class after the takeover so thought this was a good opportunity. There is a separate counter for business class passengers where the staff was able to courteously check in and provide the lounge access voucher as well. The flight was delayed as the incoming flight was delayed and the crew were able to proactively communicate this fact to the passengers including the arrival of the flight which was good. It seems that even though the seats are quite spacious, this airbus 321 was also showing its signs of ageing as well. The seat also had newspapers / magazines which once could read but there was definitely an upgrade of the soft aspects of the product. On board the crew were welcoming and as a welcome drink there was a choice between buttermilk and coconut water and they have had also given hot towels which was very greatly appreciated as they are quite valuable which was not given before. Also there were menu cards distributed for the dinner option before take off as the crew noted down the orders. Previously the meals options used to be on laminated cards. I had opted for the fish curry with okra and that was quite a good and filling option along with a chocolate mousse cake for dessert. Unfortunately due to turbulence the crew were unable to do the beverage service which was good. Baggage retrieval was also swift. Overall I feel that the soft product was markedly improved from the last time I flew them in J class including the hot towels and menu cards with greater options but with the induction of new aircraft and refurbishment of cabin interiors I am quite optimistic that the business class product could get even better in the future. Only issue was the delay but that was due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft.",yes

However, the food I was very highly dissatisfied with. They started our journey with cold baba ghanouj, and cold hummus with hard bread. That as a starter no one seemed to enjoy. Out of the Asian elders did not even know what baba ghanouj was. An elder couple behind me asked them to help me with their order as they were wanted veg only. I was happy to help. For the main course, it was an option between paneer or millet steak (vegetarian). As the air hostess was coming around to take our order, she tried to convince me and my family to order the millet steak saying it’s very good. I told her I would not like that, and I wanted the paneer. After two mins she came to inform us they all are out of panner and the rest of us will get millet steak. I was seating in seat number 9; I couldn’t imagine why we paid so much more for business class; when we didn’t even have a choice what we want as a main meal. The millet steak was so disgusting. Everyone behind me and towards the back of business class was upset.

AirIndia,2,"""entire experience left us deeply disappointed""",M Kulkarni,27th October 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | My family and I have consistently had disappointing experiences when traveling with Air India. This time, it was my parents' first trip from New Delhi to San Francisco, leaving much to be desired. I had explicitly booked extra legroom seats for my parents, as it was a gruelling 16-hour flight, and I paid for these seats when I booked the tickets. However, upon boarding the plane, my parents were assigned seats in the middle section, as the extra legroom seats they had paid for had been given to other passengers who made a last-minute payment for those seats at the airport. This was not an isolated incident. A similar situation occurred in 2022 when my husband and brother traveled from New Delhi to San Francisco. To their surprise, their extra legroom seats were also sold to other passengers during check-in. It's evident that this is not a mere mistake but a recurring issue. It's deeply concerning that Air India's ground staff and crew members seem complicit in this practice. It appears they are profiting from this by allowing passengers to book extra legroom seats online, only to resell the same seats for additional rupees to other passengers during check-in. My parents were left with no other options, and the crew members displayed extreme rudeness by suggesting that my parents deboard and resolve the issue at the check-in counter. This is a clear indication that there's a systemic problem within Air India, and this practice is tarnishing the airline's reputation. To make matters worse, I applied for a refund, but Air India never refunded the money my parents paid for these extra legroom seats. This entire experience has left us deeply disappointed and frustrated, and it raises serious questions about the integrity and customer service standards of Air India. Such practices are unethical and damaging to the airline's reputation. Air India must take immediate action to rectify these issues and ensure that passengers receive the services they pay for and are entitled to.",no

AirIndia,1,"""deep disappointment and frustration""",Ravinder Kaur,9th October 2023,"Not Verified |  I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding my recent travel experience with Air India. On August 31, 2023, I had booked a flight (AI-309) from Melbourne to Delhi scheduled to depart at 8:00 AM. Unfortunately, this journey turned into a chaotic and inconvenient ordeal due to the cancellation of the flight and the subsequent mismanagement of the situation. The cancellation of the flight itself was a major inconvenience. I had specifically chosen a direct flight for the ease and comfort of traveling with my 3-year-old daughter. The direct flight option was the primary reason for selecting Air India for this trip. However, when I arrived at the airport, I was informed that the flight had been canceled. This abrupt change in plans disrupted my entire travel schedule. To make matters worse, the alternative flight that was offered to us, Sri Lanka Airlines to Colombo, was not only indirect but also experienced significant delays. This unexpected detour further complicated our travel plans and added unnecessary stress to an already frustrating situation. The lack of clear communication and contingency planning was evident throughout this experience. One of the most concerning aspects of this ordeal was the lack of consideration for the well-being of my 3-year-old daughter and me during the extended waiting period. We were forced to wait at the airport for 8 hours, during which no meals were provided for my child. This is unacceptable and demonstrates a lack of basic care for passengers, especially young children who rely on a regular meal schedule. The inconvenience caused to my daughter, who was hungry and tired, is deeply distressing. I must express my disappointment with the overall handling of this situation by Air India. As a result of this experience, I have lost faith in the reliability and customer service of your airline. I can assure you that I will not consider Air India for any future travel plans, and I will actively discourage friends and family from doing so as well.",no

AirIndia,1,"""seats were worn out, uncomfortable""",N Panir,9th October 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is regarding my recent round-trip experience on Air India flights from Toronto to Delhi and back. To begin with, the aircraft on both journeys appeared to be in a state of disrepair. The seats were worn out, uncomfortable, and lacked proper cushioning. The tray tables were broken in several instances, making it difficult to utilize them for any purpose. The in-flight entertainment system, or lack thereof, was another major issue. On both flights, the screens were either malfunctioning or next to non-existent. My family was left with no entertainment options during the entire duration of the journey, which was particularly disheartening considering the long hours spent onboard. Moreover, the meal service on these flights was subpar. The food quality was far from satisfactory, with unappetizing taste and limited options. As a vegetarian, I found the lack of suitable choices even more disappointing.

We fought for some rest and sleep for lounge access. None was given, after much argument. Only a veg lunch voucher was given, estimated 450rp per person (there were 3 of us). In all of this no one apologised. The duty personnel in Changi Airport on the 9th past midnight to early morning 8.30am at the gate were hopeless and offered no sympathy or help. No one from Air India were at the transfer desk at 6am that morning to arrange for the new boarding passes. It was all left to Changi Airport staff to assist (and they were also clueless what was happening.  We were lied that we were to be placed on the 2.40am SQ flight to Delhi. In India upon landing, the Air India staff were clueless too. They even can tell us the midnight flight to Delhi did take off as per their system.  Following this I wrote at least 4 emails to vent my anger. All I received was a cancellation letter of my flight.

You could enter one number or letter and it would open a blank 2nd page. If, as I did, you went back to the first page, you could enter a 2nd letter and the same thing happened. So I keep proceeding and then it took all my personal info. When I submitted to pay (with credit card) the site twirled and twirled for minutes. I got no confirmation of payment or reservation so obviously it bombed. I was not going to try again and filed a case # problem. Then I called Air India and after being kept on hold for 10 minutes reached someone who, after hearing what I just wrote and after being told I could send him the screen shots of what I had saved, including the price, wanted to start from scratch and charge me an extra $20 US because I was using the telephone. If I wanted the same price, I would have to wait 24 hours, then contact Air India again. Does he really think I'm going to try a 3rd time? Great customer service Air India.",no

Are you guys seriously following this while entering to the flight after security is being done? I visited India after 1.5 years and was talking sweets with me to Berlin from the duty free products for which there was a rule ""it wasn't included!"". But suddenly Air India have to weigh after security is done just to earn money! Staff members at the gate were so excited to earn 4500 Rs per kg for 5kgs overweight in the hand luggage that was increased when I brought Duty Free. I have seen now Air India has downgraded its royalty in my eyes. The employees at the gate asked me to throw all the stuff including the sweets. From now on I will never choose Air India.",no

From the fellow passengers I understand this is not the first time happening, its an ongoing thing with Air India. Don't use Air India if you want to reach your destination on time.

Reason given to us was Operational Reasons. It took nearly three and half hours. Then my screen on 33 A was not working.

This is only the beginning of a story of a nightmare and irresponsibility of the Air India. The next flight was two days after and we were stuck in Delhi and they refused to cover the minimum of the hotel for two days (they only gave us refund for one night). They promised to refund the taxi back to the airport but this didn't happen as well. In the airport, they lost our new ticket and it took an hour to get it back. We spent hours to argue with the workers of the airline and it were not honest. They promised lot of things but they were tricking us with all kind of excuses that were not real (they said there isn't more ticket in an other flight, and indeed there were, they said the manager left home and indeed he was there, and so on). Bottom line - we had a lot of expenses due to Air India improper service. We paid one night hotel, the taxi to the airport, food and living expenses and of course we lost two days of work at home.

Secondly, the screens don’t work at all in the flight, even if they work the remotes don’t work, which is a big problem in flights with long routes.

AirIndia,7,"""Business class is not roomy""",R Marden,11th September 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Business Class on Air India was just barely worth the extra cost. For one thing, they are using a domestic plane with one center aisle, so 4 seats across in business and 6 across in economy. There was nothing in the way of entertainment, not even a screen. Business class is not roomy, particularly when seats are reclined in front of you. Perhaps acceptable for domestic travel, but not for international. Service by the crew was fine, although they have an odd way of serving meal; the man next to me finished his meal before I even received mine. The problem with the menu and the choices is that unless you are Indian, if you are like me, you have no idea what anything is. Thus I ordered the one Western offering which was some sort of spaghetti mashup. It was not made clear to me that I also had a choice of appetizers and desserts. It certainly was a pleasant flight, if unremarkable in any way. This was my first time to have narrow bodied plane on this route. I hope it is my last.",yes
AirIndia,8,"""a really comfortable and good flight""",V Reddy,11th September 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I had to take the evening flight out from Bangalore to Mumbai over the weekend and after checking in and dropping the baggage got to know that the flight was delayed due to the inbound flight from Mumbai being delayed. As this was the weekend the flight was quite full and I got to know from the crew that there was 1 passenger who was even allotted the jump seat. One thing that was noticed was that even though the flight was delayed the crew and pilots were quite apologetic about it and explained the reasons for the delay. However the pilots were in a rush and they didn't even announce nor notify the crew about taking their positions during take-off and the crew had to rush to their jump seats. On this sector I had noticed my co-passenger who was sitting next to me was not feeling well and the crew was constantly monitoring him and looking after him giving him bottles of water to make him comfortable which was quite great from the crew. For dinner I had opted for the non veg option that included a stuff paratha, chicken masala with rice along with salad and a chocolate cake. The meal was pretty good. Landing into BOM was on time and was able to also get my baggage as well. Apart from the delay this was a really comfortable and good flight.",yes

My tray table was broken and was unable to hold a tray of food without me holding it up with my other hand. Otherwise, the food would’ve spilled onto my lap. The staff was kind and nice. They served us properly. But the airplane itself was uncomfortable, unclean, and broken in many ways. The seats were old and uncomfortable.

The pilot claims the ground technicians were trying to fix the fan but were not successful. The outside temperature was 34C on Sept 03/2023, you can imagine the inside temp without a fan. They could fix it before boarding passengers on the aircraft. It became fine after take off but was a long wait in a hot hot cabin. I should acknowledge that the helpful hostesses were handing a cup of water to people who wanted to drink at this time.

It was still 2 minutes left for the baggage counter closure at 12:13 PM but the lady on the Air India baggage counter D19 denied to take the bag saying that I am late and the counter is closed now. I requested her very politely for help but there wasn't even an effort for help. She rudely asked me to go to Ticket Counter and when I did, Air India executive asked me to cancel my current check in and pay late fees (saying that I have to show as if I didn't turn up for the flight and came just before the flight take off) and then pay additional fee for reschedule.

The Flight AI687/07Aug BOM DEL departure was revised at 1800hrs without giving any reason to passengers. Due to the delayed departure of AI687/07Aug BOM DEL, they were rescheduled to fly on the next day after 24 hrs. Had AI staff tried and communicated with staff in Delhi, there was a possibility to be able to catch onward flight for Tokyo. But no such attempt was even tried by the staff. There were other direct flights from DEL-Tyo (ANA or JAL) on same day which could have been the next option. But no sincere attempts were made. As a result, my in-laws lost one complete day. They were then sent to hotel Sukh at Juhu. To travel to hotel it took 3 hrs taxi ride and while coming back it was 2 hrs. My in-laws started their Journey from Nashik at 6 am in morning and could only reach the hotel at 9 pm. It could have been so easily a hotel near airport. On second day (8-Aug), they were picked up at around 11:00 am and made to catch 3:30 pm flight without lunch being offered. The hotel even didn’t have basic facilities like soap availability. As a common traveler, I can easily understand that 4:00 pm flight being very important for travelers who connect to other international flights from Delhi. There should be alternative arrangements to make people catch the connecting flights. If it was known that 4:00 pm flight is going to be delayed and there is no other flight available until 6:00 pm, why efforts were not made to accommodate few passengers who have connections in earlier 3:30 pm We had to cancel all arrangements made for their pick up and re-book the car with driver from Tokyo. Upon communication with AI they just offered apology. But, didn’t even bother to promise improvements. If it continues like this, AI would soon lose their customer base.

Ear jacks not working I watched the movie without sound. The beverage services is ridiculous, I asked for extra beer and the air hostess was like she would give it in another round, well another round never came.

AirIndia,3,"""no different from a low-budget airline""",S Marton,7th August 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Disappointing Experience. I recently traveled on Air India from Cochin to Dubai on July 12th, and returned from Dubai to Cochin on July 17th. I am writing to express my disappointment with the overall experience and share my feedback regarding the flight. When I booked my tickets, I had high expectations, considering that Tata Group had taken over Air India. However, I was disheartened to discover that the flight experience was no different from a low-budget airline, especially when compared to the services provided by airlines like Emirates or Qatar Airways. It was quite disconcerting to find that Air India, which is still considered a low-cost carrier, had higher prices compared to other budget airlines. Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention an incident that occurred during my return journey. During check-in, I had checked in baggage weighing 26.5 kg and carried a hand luggage of 7 kg. At no point during the check-in process did the counter staff inform me that there was an opportunity to accommodate an additional 4 kg of weight, which would have allowed me to make purchases from the duty-free area. Instead, I was informed just before boarding that there would be a weight check, and any excess weight would be subject to an additional charge of 50 dirhams per kilogram. This approach to charging passengers for excess weight without prior information or the chance to adjust the baggage is disheartening, especially considering the concept of making money seems to overshadow the overall passenger experience. To comply with the sudden weight restriction, I had to rush back to the duty-free area and drop the items I had purchased. I was warned by your staff that I might face deportation if I delayed the process. As a Gold member of Qatar Airways, I am familiar with the rules and consequences of deportations, so I complied without any arguments and quickly resolved the issue. This incident has left a significant impact on my perception of Indian airlines. I now question the level of service and commitment to passenger comfort offered by airlines, whether it is Air India under Tata ownership or any other Indian carrier. The flight experience itself was underwhelming, with seats resembling those found on ordinary buses, causing discomfort and subsequent back pain. Considering the recent acquisition by Tata Group, I had hoped for a significant improvement in Air India's services, but unfortunately, it seems that Air India remains unchanged. It is disheartening to witness a lack of luxury or any additional features that are commonly associated with globally recognized and exclusive airlines. This experience has left me deeply disappointed, and I feel compelled to share my concerns with you. I hope that my feedback can serve as a catalyst for necessary improvements in your services and customer experience. As a frequent traveler, I believe it is essential for airlines to prioritize passenger comfort, communication, and transparency to build a positive reputation. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I sincerely hope that Air India will take necessary steps to enhance its services in the future.",no

Two out of three in-flight entertainment screens in my row were dead, which is something of a letdown given that we were on a 15 hour flight. But the food and overall service were top-notch. Upon landing in Chennai, we faced the dreaded baggage problem. Our checked-in bags seemed to have gone on their own adventure somewhere else. After waiting for what felt like an eternity, the Air India representatives finally approached us. They were polite, but there was something off about their response. I couldn't shake the feeling that they weren't entirely transparent with us.

Without recounting every horror story that I have about Air India, I will simply, and briefly share my experience with Air India flying back from CCU to EWR on June 30, 2023. As we got to the airport I was prepared for the rudeness. The staff members of Indigo, Spice, etc., seemed to be treating their customers in a friendly manner, however, Air India staff seemed just sad, and pathetic. So then we get on our flight from CCU to DEL. The food is inedible, the AC doesn’t seem to be working, and the flight attendants were missing for the rest of the flight. Okay, so then we get to Delhi. Now, I don’t if it’s just an attitude issue, perhaps something cultural, in Delhi, or Air India. But Air India staff there are not only rude but also just pathetically incompetent. Somehow, I got called in for “a secondary inspection.” Apparently having a Zippo (without fuel) is not allowed by CISF. Anyway, so after being harassed by them, I get back to the gate and the Air India staff has somehow lost my boarding pass, which they had kept when I went to see the CISF people. Instead of apologizing and reissuing a pass two Air India staff kept arguing with me that they don’t have my boarding pass. Finally, they find it. Again no apology. So, I being exhausted, get on the flight. This time I had made sure to get on the flight early, since on my way to Kolkata, they could not find a space for my cabin luggage so I had to store them in two different overhead bins. So I was relieved when I saw the overhead bins empty (I had booked extra legroom seats). However, the moment I start putting my luggage, an anxious flight attendant runs towards me and starts scolding me. I inform her that it was my seat and I will keep my luggage there. She proceeds to tell me that the overhead bin is reserved for “oversized baggage.” So at this point, I lose my cool. So, let me understand this, instead of enforcing the rule regarding baggage size and weight, like a normal airline, Air India has decided to punish passengers who ARE following the rule. Anyway I told the flight attendant that I will be keeping my bag where it is and that’s that. She mumbled something about people brining 4 bags instead of 2. Whatever! However, somehow this flight attendant seemed to be the one serving my seat for the whole 14 hour flight. As expected the in-flight entertainment system did not work. Funnily the guy seating beside me had his remote literally torn off from his seat. However, I regret eating the pathetic food that Air India provided. I kid you not, the salad they gave was literally rotten. Didn’t they know that Mayonnaise rots very easily, and DOES NOT need to be warmed up? What was worse than the food was that the same flight attendant kept pushing my buttons throughout the flight. At some point, like a good passenger I had kept my trash ready to be given back to the attendant after dinner. However, when the attendant came, she seemed agitated, gestured toward the front of the flight, and said “You can throw it in.",no
AirIndia,2,"""most disappointed""",S Sethi,18th July 2023,"Not Verified |  My flight was supposed to depart New Delhi at 2300hrs. It was first delayed until 0200hrs on the following day. Closer to the time, they delayed it further to 0500hrs. No reason provided. I am still at the airport in New Delhi. Do not know if they will delay it, most disappointed with this supposedly new era of Air India. In May 23 also travelled in this airline when we found the food on board was inedible and the inflight entertainment system was not working. It's was on the premium sector of London to New Delhi.",no
AirIndia,7,"""this was a welcome flight""",Ashish Varun,18th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  I took this early morning flight which at the time of booking was a pretty good reasonable rate. The online check in was done smoothly and at the airport the bag drop was also done well and swiftly. Boarding also started well on time and was surprised to note that this was a full flight at such an odd hour and the aircraft type was the bigger A321 for this sector. I had noticed that there was a passenger who was having slight difficulty but the crew was able to talk to her make her calm which was a good thing to see. Also surprisingly on this flight sector I had noticed that there were snacks being offered on this flight as previously on this sector they used to give only a sandwich. I had opted for the non veg refreshments which consisted of pasta with chicken along with a nice chocolate cake for dessert and the food quality was pretty good. Landing and arrival into BLR was also well ahead of time. However when the time came to collect the baggage, I had noticed that again the new bag tag which I had attached with my name was no longer present and this was a bag tag that I had just purchased recently and put. Even last week when I travelled from Kolkata to Mumbai even then my baggage tag was removed off, so it seems that Air India is having issues with my baggage tag and probably this is something that they need to look into. But other than that, this was a welcome flight and I am hoping that the next time I travel, they give refreshments service rather than the plain sandwich that they usually give.",yes
AirIndia,1,"""company to really avoid""",Nicola Mazzucchelli,18th July 2023,"Not Verified | Flight to go to India was 9 hrs delayed. Today flew back to Italy 7 hrs delay.

The air hostesses, Praveet and Preeti, were exceptional in their duties and displayed a remarkable level of professionalism throughout the flight. While the overall service was commendable, I would like to bring to your attention a minor issue regarding the in-flight entertainment system. Unfortunately, the screens in our section were not working properly.",no
AirIndia,2,"""entertainment did not work""",valentine Beatini,18th July 2023,"Not Verified | Bad experience. 2 long flights, 6 hours delay without compensation. On both flights, the sockets and the entertainment did not work. Not mine, nor the socket of the adjacent seats. The cabin staff is nice and pretends that the problem is solvable, but they seem pretty aware that it is not. For the delay, upon request, a ticket was provided for a lounge which was actually a loud café offering another meal very much like the one on the plane, and 0.33 ml water.",no
AirIndia,1,"""The service was non-existent""",S Jensen,18th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  With Tata having purchased Air India and Air India being a Star Alliance partner I thought what could go wrong. My new name for Air India is Air Never Again. The seats, service, cleanliness and ticketing were all terrible. We flew nine carriers on our month-long trip. None of them were close to being as bad as Air India. The discount air carriers Scoop and Batik put Air India to shame. The direct competitors Singapore, United and Cathay were so far superior that you'd have to drug me and tie to a seat to ever get me to set foot on Air India again. The plane was filthy. The seats torture devices left over from the Middle Ages. My in-seat entertainment system was broken but functional. I pointed it out so that it might be serviced on the ground and got a, ""no, one cares shrug"". The service was non-existent. The flight attendants made two appearances and then were nowhere to be found after meal and drink service. They just disappeared while leaving water in the open galley. The food was the worst of any airline food I've eaten or tried to eat. The beverage service was miserly. Nope. One and done. Loved India. Been there several times. Will go again just not on Air India.",no
AirIndia,6,"""I would still recommend""",S Hashun,18th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  As I had booked this flight at a discount rate, I was a bit anxious about whether I would get a seat on this flight considering it was the weekend and planes have been flying full literally. To my surprise, I didn't have to wait for long in order to check in and get my boarding pass. The flight boarding and departure were on time and there were a few vacant seats. For breakfast I opted for the veg option which was consisting of an uttapam, sev upma, a croissant with mango yogurt which was pretty good. However, during the beverage service, I noticed that the staff were initially serving the front couple of rows but then due to turbulence they had to stop it midway but didn't bother to proactively ask the passengers for beverages when they were taking away the eating trays which was a surprise. Perhaps they might have just forgotten or due to the turbulence they had to stop it midway without asking passengers but either way that wasn't good. Arrival to Mumbai was on time however I had noticed that upon retrieval of my luggage, my baggage name tag that I had put had got torn out which was not good as previously back in January too they had misplaced my luggage and again they had not handled the baggage properly so this is something that they need to look into. I would still recommend as I got huge value for the fare that I paid.",yes
AirIndia,1,"""first and last flight with Air India""",K Singh,18th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I travelled in direct flight from Toronto to Delhi with my brother on 26 June 2023. The entire plane smelled like public washroom. It was so disgusting. The entertainment screen was not working for me and my brother and for many more people. We informed the crew member and she assured it will be fixed soon. Two hours later when I asked them again, all they had to say was ""sorry, we tried but only technical person will be able to fix it"". The meal they served was not fresh. My brother had booked non-veg option for meal when booking tickets and he got vegetarian meal, that too, 1 hour late than others and had hair in it. When we asked the crew, she said their economy meal was over so they are serving whatever they could arrange. You guys are not even aware how many people are flying with you, forget the rest. WE PAID $2300 CAD for the ticket which I think was not worth it. This was probably my first and last flight with Air India. Never travelling again and won't even recommend it to anyone.",no
AirIndia,2,"""Again bad experience""",Radha Rani,18th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Unfortunately again experiencing this airline, and it’s air-conditioning not working. We all are sitting and waiting for more than 40 minutes in plane without air-conditioning right away. Again bad experience.",no

Me and my family were traveling to London last month by Air India. I would like to say that their Flights are really in bad conditions. Food was not cooked. Chicken they served was uncooked. TV screens were not working at all, while going to London only one screen was working from our row. But while returning back all three screens were not in a working condition. Also I had ordered a kids meal for my baby, but they also forgot that. If we had called them for any assistance there was nobody there to help. Staff were in their own world. I will never recommend this airline to anybody.",no

AirIndia,10,"""top notch crew experience""",T Sharma,5th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I had the opportunity to travel on AI flights twice in the last 3 months during my trips to India. I haven't been adventurous enough to try them out international as I've heard my share of horror stories. I'm going to base my review on the 2 Pune-Delhi flights I've taken in this period. Booking: AI fares were similar or cheaper than the corresponding fares on no frills airlines. AI is full service. Which means 25 kgs of check-in luggage and meals served on-board. A huge win right away. Online booking was easy and not complicated compared to some top notch international airlines sites. Rating: 10/10 Check In: The check-in counter for AI literally had no queues while the rest of the airlines had long ones. That did make me somewhat nervous the first time. As it turns out eventually, the flights both times were completely full so I have no idea how they managed to avoid queues at check-in. Maybe fewer flights? Nevertheless, the check-in agent was quick, efficient, polite, addressed me properly by name and directed me to my gate. I was out and about in no time - both times. No complaints. Rating: 10/10 Boarding: Boarding commenced 10 mins later than scheduled. On both the flights I took. However the boarding process was quick and smooth and the lot of us were on board in no time. Rating: 8/10 Crew: On both occasions, the cabin stewards / stewardesses were polite, efficient and thoroughly professional. Albeit the first flight, they weren't overly keen to smile. On the second flight, they were in the finest spirits they could possibly be and literally went overboard to please. A very very warm welcome and top notch crew experience. 10/10 The craft: This was an older A320. Not the Neo version. Strangely, there was a defunct screen on the back of the seat in front of me and I had (non working) screen controls. None of the others did. I guess, they reused some seats from other aircraft. The seat pitch was pretty comparable to other domestic carriers. At 5ft7, I had decent enough knee room. But the seat width - that was definitely a bonus. Wider than economy seats in not just other domestic flights, but much wider than the seats in many international long hauls on the newer A350s and B787s. That made a huge impact and I did not have to fight it out with my co-passenger for rights over the arm rest. Of course, the cabin did look a bit dated with some scuff marks on the plastics. But it was all clean and the colour scheme was uplifting. Rating: 7/10 Meals: Dinner was served. Chicken korma with rice and some veggies. Some yoghurt and a brownie cake. Was decent fare. Served with steel cutlery. Thank you AI! International carriers make note, it's criminal to serve food with plastic cutlery. Why do you do it? The cutlery looked a big light and flimsy and I did a stress test, it was actually quite rigid and strong. Well done. Service was quick and as efficient as how I was getting used to by now. 8/10 Punctuality: Both times on AI, the flight took off ahead of schedule and reached New Delhi 30-35 mins ahead of schedule! I repeat - 30-35 mins ahead of schedule. On a flight that had a flying time of about 2 hrs!! This is serious WOW. Super impressed. 10/10! Extras: Throughout the trip, I kept getting emails and SMSs from AI with status updates on departure gates and other bits and bobs of info. I even got alerts for when my bags were loaded onto the aircraft. Who does that?! Whopping 10/10 Overall: An overwhelmingly surprised 10/10.",yes

After making us sit inside the plane they announced that flight delayed by one hour due to congestion, no news after even two hours and then started giving us excuses like ground staff clearance and after 6 hours sitting in the plane they started fueling. There were a lot of arguments in the plane with staff and ground clearance but they never listened. Most probably they did not have to fuel or their was an issue between pilot and ground staff as the pilot after being coerced after nearly 4 hours of no response from him announced that ground staff will speak. The pilot never came out of the cockpit to speak to the passengers, never seen such kind of chaos. Will never fly air india",no

I travelled from Singapore to Bangalore and then boarded Air India. The flight left my baggage at Bangalore and I had to waste 2 hrs in Mumbai airport. I was told that in my baggage side pocket there was a lighter. I acknowledged and appreciated their promptness. On my return the flight was again delayed by 2 hrs. Someone opened my bag and lifted it. The food served inflight during lunch was also pathetic. I had planned to have my lunch in Bangalore however due to a delay had to rely on Air India.

Normally 787 has a high level of humidity and moisture but these aircraft were very dry don't know did they change the settings as a result you feel quite dry on these flights.

To our shock, the seat was completely broken, no headphones were working, the touch was off and the button to adjust the seat was also broken. So, just imagine how does it feel when you are told that you have to sit in upright position for next 14 hours. I am taking Air India off my list now, never ever travelling back in Air India again. We complained to the Air Hostess, she said, ""Yeah can't help it, I will reboot the system, there might be some technical glitch or let me find some other seat for you"" but she did not do anything.

No flight attendant came to even offer water after 3-4 hours. Snacks were given before the beginning of the flight. In 14 hours of the flight only 1 time a meal was provided, there was also no warm food. Customer service is getting worse day by day. Everyone expected that since Mr. Ratan Tata took over Air India, he would make necessary steps to improve customer service, make flight tickets more reasonable and improvements in aircraft interior including TV screens in front of the seats but unfortunately nothing has improved. It is disappointing. At the airport after checking in for the international flight from Delhi to Toronto, my mother-in-law was harassed for return flight which was not booked at that time. Couple of staff members of the STAR ALLIANCE harassed her and took her boarding pass and refused to let her go to board on flight 45min before the departure of the flight to Toronto. I do not understand who gives airlines (Air India or Star Alliance) authority to ask for passengers return flight? This is ridiculous and I hope my message reaches the right authority in India to take necessary steps to stop such nonsense behavior at the airport.

AI has given nothing but lousy service and that is being generous. I landed in Delhi at 11pm and my plane to Toronto was supposed to leave at 3.35am. They said that it was delayed and will start at 5am. The staff made a big show of checking documents which started at 3.30am. Our documents were checked three times at least. Just to kill time and to make a show that something was being done! There was no order to the boarding! We boarded around 4 am and now it’s 7am and we are still sitting on the plane- a closed space, with people coughing. In 3 hours no water was even served and besides the initial announcement no updates to the passengers. We are being treated as cattle and not human beings. There’s no courtesy of keeping us in the loop. This is a broken down plane. Nothing works. For a 14 1/2 hour non-stop flight, there’s no entertainment. Honestly, at this point I wonder if I will get where I need to get, alive and in one piece. AI is playing with our lives and is being extremely disrespectful of our time. We have lives and jobs to get to and there’s a reason we plan a trip.

Passengers were barred from entering the airport building as the flight was delayed to avoid overcrowding and a makeshift counter without personnel was arranged and of course without a proper seating facility. There were hardly 15 chairs for more than 100 people. As it is summer in Saudi Arabia the temperature outside was around 40 degrees Celsius. The airline representative appeared once in a while and responded rudely to any queries on flight status. Experience inside the plane is another horrible experience. We felt like we were in an airplane just because it was flying. Other than that it is comparable to local buses in developing countries. Seats were small and uncomfortable even with economy standards. Regarding the food, I bet it cannot be any cheaper than what was served. I have pledged not to travel with Air India anymore.

It is unimaginable in 2023. If the screen works the audio does not work and Vice versa.

AirIndia,9,"""a very good flight""",S Vashun,14th June 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was a flight that I had to take early morning due to the alternatives having much higher fares especially over weekends. The check in for the flight and the ground experience was quite good and even the flight boarding started on time for what seemed to be like a 90-95% full flight. The staff at check-in offered me seat 4F at the front that had no other seats in front of them which resulted in extra legroom. Pushback started on time and once airborne the breakfast service commenced and I had opted for the non veg course that consisted of an omlette, chicken sausage with spinach and hash browns. along with a croissant and yoghurt. The meal itself was pretty good. However one thing that I had noticed which was not appreciated was the fact that the tray table was not properly cleaned. The landing happened on time and I had no difficulty in getting my luggage. Overall for the price that was paid, this was actually a very good flight. Thanks to the crew and team.",yes

They said you will get email after some time, as PNR is generated no issue. We trusted them and returned back to hotel. We didn't receive the email at all and we contacted the costumer service they also said its okay just go to airport and get the boarding pass. We went to airport little early (2am) with all our luggage, and child. When we arrived they said that in your name no seats book and all seats are full we cannot help you. We showed PNR number, they said but as you didn't get email we cant do anything. We went to manager of the Air India, she didn't show any interest in helping or solving the issue. We checked with other airlines. They had 2 seats, one seat like that so we had to book new tickets again with Vistara next day morning (3am) and we returned back to hotel again with all our bags (25kg bags, hand luggage) and child. Horrible service by Air India. Horrible staff members and irresponsible, non cooperative. They were all laughing making fun of each other and customers, no seriousness and no helping nature. It all happened in Delhi international airport. As we were confused and standing what to do, we were just observing them, they are so careless even for old people who are approaching them and they don't know the language Hindi or English.

The flight was scheduled to take off at 10:45 AM but was delayed until 5:20 PM (nearly 7 hours). Everyone had to deplane. Air India only provided each of us a $15 meal voucher for the long delay. On my way back to JFK from New Delhi on Thursday, May 18th at 2:20 AM, I asked an Air India check-in rep if he could upgrade me to business class. He said no because all the seats have already been taken. When I boarded and got off that flight, I saw that wasn't the case. I decided to submit a case on the Air India website and then was prompted to email [email protected]. I sent them an explanation on Friday, May 19th detailing all the inconvenience that was caused. Surprisingly, they replied to my email on the same day saying that they have ""shared details with the concerned airport"" and once they receive a response, they will get back to me.  I never received a response from them ever again. I requested a follow-up on May 29th, May 30th, and finally June 6th via email. I also called Air India on June 6th, but the rep kept asking me for my ticket number. I informed him that I've already flown and do not remember my ticket number. I asked him how I can find out this number. He didn't provide any assistance. Instead, he only repeated himself and decided to hang up. Very frustrating.

AirIndia,2,"""hated my overall flight experience""",A Harnasha,9th June 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  I did not like the plane's interior quality and how it was maintained. The plane was so old that the seats and infotainment systems were broken. People were literally trying to change seats to watch something in the screens. The most ridiculous part of all is that a manual in airlines said to not remove shoes. The people removed shoes and literally lied down on the seats, with blankets on, as if it were their beds at home. The crew did not care and was least concerned about correcting the mess. The washrooms were clogged and stinky. The attendant call was not heard for 45 minutes and till the time I stopped one myself to ask for water. I hated my overall flight experience. I don't know if these reviews are heard and seen by this airline to improve their service, but my experience travelling with them was the worst of all the airlines I have travelled with. I hope the review is heard and service is improved to make an impression.",no

Another part had a 9.40 hours continuous flight from Gatwick to Goa there were no charging points working, all were broken.  When asked for assistance to crew members they were like ""I am sorry"". Seats were full of debris, window mirror was not wiped there were stains on it. Avoid booking Air India. Made a big mistake. After coming down to Goa airport there was a layover for about 5 hours and after standing in a cue for 1.5 hours for check in again the staff said you have to wait for ""30 minutes more"".

AirIndia,1,"""old planes with no inflight entertainment""",Intan Nurhati,9th June 2023,"Not Verified |  I took Air India for a G20 meeting as an official. The major disappointments are old planes with no inflight entertainment, and incompetent and rude ground services. I would give the credits to cabin crews who tried their best to be helpful though. Check in staffs need to be better informed on visa requirements, so not to annoy customers with proper requirements waiting. India's chaotic airport security is already a nightmare, but a ground staff in Delhi made it worse. In my experience, airport security staffs made a horrible mistake of not stamping my boarding pass. And an Air India staff at the boarding gate was very rude as if I was someone with a security risk. He made me wait to board the plane last without a proper explanation, to a point that a security lady was nice enough to give a calming gesture and signalling the boarding staff is rather a rude one.",no

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

With regards to drinks, it was pretty decent with good brands. The TV was working properly, but I usually see the maps and do some work or read books. Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.

The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best.

I was informed that the flight has been cancelled from Tel Aviv from where I had my connecting flight. After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account. For almost an year of a try they have not initiated the refund and the reason they have is of no show?

The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience.

The airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past. On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good.

When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18.

I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip.

My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",no

After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name. People of India are normally cost conscious and that's the only reason I guess they fly with AI when they get a better deal but I feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this.",no
AirIndia,3,"""Complete disaster""",Neeraj Jaggi,18th March 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable.",no

Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious.

It supposed to person who has book vegetarian food should have first priority not the last. In return on 1 March, same issue. Even when they serve the food, tea cup was dirty.

Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight.

AirIndia,8,"""service was quite nice""",V Abbas,5th March 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",yes

The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days.

She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help.

We have requested a basinet seat and they told us that you should request it at the check-in counter so they can give it to you. When we went to the airport for check-in, we came to know that our flight was 4 hours late and they said basinet seat is not available. Everything was okay for us other than not informing us for flight was late. When we asked them about our next flight connection, they had no answer about it. When we reached Delhi, we came to know that our next flight was the next morning. As I had 2 kids with me i asked them to provide accommodation but they refused to provide any accommodation. It was a horrible experience for us that they are not happy to understand the situation of their customer.  Customer service desk people are hopeless, they are not happy to listen anything as it is our problem that our air India flight was late. Never travel with this airline. They are hopeless.",no

I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic staff was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable. Did they think we were going to be happy they put us in a hotel that's like a jail cell with no windows. A dump. Disgusting airline and pathetic after service. No responsibility. No accountability. No explanations given.",no
AirIndia,8,"""its prices are reasonable""",R Bardin,18th February 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  I chose to fly Air India because of its Star Alliance affiliation and the fact that its prices are reasonable. In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight.

AirIndia,1,"""hygiene on these flights is horrendous""",Sagel Patel,14th January 2023,"Not Verified |  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.",no

AirIndia,1,"""2 day delay in our travel plan""",N Shantar,14th January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work. This has essentially ruined what was a pretty good trip up to this point. Never again.",no
AirIndia,1,"""Air India is disgusting""",Sana Patel,14th January 2023,✅ Trip Verified |  Air India is disgusting. They removed us from the flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent. They then think they are doing us a favour by booking us in a hotel and on the next flight which is a whole 24 hours later. The hotel is a dump. It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are.,no
AirIndia,5,"""does not reflect well on the new owners""",V Reddy,14th January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers. I have already had 2 negative experiences travelling on the airline within the space of 2 months.",no
AirIndia,1,"""check in was chaotic and unorganised""",Rameez Qamar,14th January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | This is our national carrier and unfortunately one of the worst and most unprofessional airlines. You’d never come across a staff smiling (ground or air), the crew are aging and consider themselves irreplaceable being in the Govt owned airline. Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed. Sadly, I will pay 50% extra to a different airline but never fly on Air India unless there are no other options available. Pathetic service and they do not deserve any sympathy.",no

AirIndia,1,"""Worst experience of my life""",J Landon,2nd January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience of my life. I paid more than $1500 to get to India from the US even though there were flights for $900. The reason is that Air India had a non-stop flight from the US. I tried to book online but had problems and had to call about changing my flight. Although I requested English speaking reps on the 800 number, all the people had only elementary understanding of English. And, for some reason, they would hang up the phone in mid-conversation. I even had a friend call and the same happened to her. I ended up talking another airline to India and flying back on Air India which was horrible and I do not recommend it. I also want to warn people. My card was charged almost $1517.49 Air India admitted the problem was on their end but I was only refunded $1253.66 For some reason they decided to keep $264.33 That is the first issue. The second was the actual flight.  I was shocked that they came around the cabin almost 2 hours into the flight with a dixie cup of water. I asked if they had a larger cup because I was very thirsty and the flight attendant either didn't understand English or she pretended she didn't understand English, because she shrugged and walked away. The food was horrible, the seats were horrible and had very little room, non of the screens worked and, even worse, none of the outlets that are in planes for recharging your device worked. When I ran out of battery on my iPad I tried to read but the light did not work in my entire row. One of the worst experiences on multiple levels. please , if you want to protect your money, and your comfort, look for another airlines.",no
AirIndia,1,"""Complete waste of money""",P Reddy,2nd January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst airline experience I've ever had. While flying from Sydney to Delhi, no gluten free food was available despite it being confirmed on the air ticket. While returning, only one of the three in flight entertainment systems were working in our row. That's 12.5 hours of staring at a screen that doesn't work with nothing else to do. This is also despite having paid close to $7000 for our flights. Complete waste of money - unlikely to ever fly with them again.",no

AirIndia,3,"""dropped the ball here big time""",V Agar,2nd January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I was booked on a waitlist flight from CCU to BOM this morning which was pretty much overbooked especially in mid week which was surprising. I had resigned myself to not getting any seat on the flight as it was pretty full but then at the last moment the supervisor managed to print my boarding pass and I believed that I was actually going to fly onboard the flight. Or so I thought. After clearing the serpentine security line I rushed to the boarding gate hoping to catch my flight. And that is when a big surprise was up in store for me where it was revealed by the boarding gate agents that I would be unable to board as a regular pax had taken my place. This was pretty jarring, especially at the last moment. So I then had to make my way back to the check in desk to retrieve my luggage which had to be offloaded from the flight. The point here is why was the boarding pass issued to me when there was no guarantee that I would get a seat onboard the flight? If the staff had informed me that there are no seats I would have understood and resigned myself to that fact. Instead by printing my boarding pass it gave me a false sense of hope which was clearly not correct. The purpose of me writing this review is not to bash anyone but to highlight there there are certain aspects of waitlist bookings that should be handled better here. I may also have to reconsider going for waitlist bookings with the airline if this practice continues. And in this regard, Air India dropped the ball here big time. I hope that the airline takes the feedback onboard here regarding this.",no

Both flights were +- full. What baffled me was, why someone in Air India would deploy this aircraft configuration for an International ""long haul"" 5.5hrs flight with seats with no seat pocket? The back of the seat only has document holder. The cabin had no power supply, no USB port so at least have seat pockets that allow customers to place their power bank in the seat pocket while charging their gadget instead of having to place the power bank in-between one's groin region. My other AI domestic flights BOM-GOI and return, had seat pockets for a 90 minute flight. This could have been a 10/10 review.",no

The check in staff at Melbourne were pleasant, helpful and efficient. We had to queue but the line kept moving. The ground staff member was cheerful and upbeat and really seemed to enjoy talking to people and took pride in his job. Our boarding was on time and orderly and our flight departed exactly on time. The highlight was the attitude of the cabin crew.  During the twelve hour flight, our cabin crew were absolutely delightful: They looked happy and we had a nice chat about the Indian wines being served on Air India during the bar service. They emanated a sense of warmth and caring. The professionalism and warmth of the cabin crew on this flight was probably the best we have ever experienced. We enjoyed the food very much also: Very nicely seasoned. We can see that the aircraft interiors are looking a little tired but we understand that a programme of refurbishment is underway.",yes

Every time they assured that the money will be refunded within next seven days but this excuse has been repeated for about seven times till date but to no avail.  I have eventually decided to forget this amount and have decided not to remind them about it anymore, as they have tired me out.

The air hostess calling light were only lighting on top of the passenger seat panel but air hostess don’t have any clue that passenger is calling them.

I felt pain after the first hour, even after I placed the neck pillow provided, it didn't help. The food was good, the toilets were clean, the stewards were not stingy on the drinks and snacks. The main reason I opted for this is because this is the only direct flight to Kochi and I thought I would be able to adjust for a 9hr flight, but I was proved wrong. The touch screen didn't work, the USB charging port and the headphone jack connector was broken. The steward was handing out landing cards to certain passengers and they should have just informed the people over the intercom to identify themselves if they needed one, I had to call out to them and then comes a volley of questions, are you a foreign national, etc.. why do they care? We know we need to fill it, this is not the first time we are traveling to India!

No blankets were provided and the food quality was inadequate. Inward journey: The entertainment system didn't work at all even though the staff tried resetting it three times.

Broken chair handles and dining trays on the 9th of Nov returning flight. Toilets are out of service due to the leakage per airlines crew. Food quality was extremely poor. Asking water on the 23rd of Oct flight, one of the crew replied “I’m busy”",yes
AirIndia,1,"""Worst airline ever""",Paras Garg,19th November 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline ever. Seats were so uncomfortable that they had plastic part visible, had back pain for week after that flight, there was no cushioning at at all in the seats. Sreens not working, restrooms were smelly. Customer care is even worst, every time you call them, they will say someone will contact you in 24 hours. It has been more than a month no contact at all.",no
AirIndia,1,"""there was no decent meal available""",M Gupta,19th November 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | We travelled from Delhi-Bangalore on 4th November 2022 for a holiday and had our return flight booked on 8th November 2022, in Business Class. Both ways we had the worst experiences regarding meals and baggage collection and transfer from aircraft to airport in Bangalore. Despite being in Business class, there was no decent meal available for people, who wanted to eat light and non spicy food. Seeing this, we booked a blend and one jain meal on our return flight. Shockingly, the blend food was spicy and had garlic in it and jain meal was also too spicy. The crew expressed inability to provide us any alternative, even such as fruits. The baggage in Bangalore could be collected by us after 45 minutes, despite having 'priority' tag on it. On reaching Delhi Airport on 8th November, it was worst. The flight attendant announced belt number-1 for baggage collection at the time of de-boarding. We waited for 30 minutes and then started searching from belt to belt and finally found our baggage for IA-507, was off loaded on belt number-5. Again after waiting for a long time, we were able to finally collect baggage. Both sides, the experience was terrible. Also that a lady seated on a seat ahead of us behaved in a very rowdy manner throughout the flight. Despite my telling the flight attendant, she did nothing about it. We were lucky that all seats were not occupied in the Business class, that day, therefore, we could change our seats on our own.",no
AirIndia,2,"""Very poor service""",Harjit Dhaliwal,19th November 2022,Not Verified |  Very poor service. Food was pathetic with no variation for lunch or dinner. No water or drink or snacks.

AirIndia,7,"""great value for money""",V Atwal,19th November 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | I had found this fare which came at a discount and thought of considering it. The check in was done properly and the last time I travelled on the airline post the Tata takeover, they had reduced the meal service so was skeptical over what the meal service was going to be like on this flight because the last time I travelled, only a sandwich as provided. The boarding started on time however the pushback got delayed by 30 mins due to the congestion at Mumbai airport which is the norm. I was also pleased to note that the ground staff offered me an extra legroom seat which was greatly appreciated. For the breakfast service I was pleasantly surprised as they were offering full breakfasts with both vegetarian as well as non vegetarian fares whereas previously only vegetarian was offered. The cutleries stainless steel instead of plastic which was a great touch. For the vegetarian fayre, it consisted of idlis, poha, croissant as well as mango yogurt along with tea / coffee which was great. The arrival was delayed by 30 minutes. But overall this was great value for money as I had got an extra legroom seat, a full breakfast with steel cutleries and good staff and crew service. I will be flying the return leg soon and I'm confident of receiving similar service. So much appreciated.",yes

Something went wrong and I couldn't access the flying return milage program. For last 5 months I have contacted air india staff in vain. Tons of back and forth emails and number of calls at customer service number. They keep passing me from person to person and asking for same document multiple times. I am fed up and frustrated following up with the AI staff and come to conclusion that they have a bunch of staff who do not care for their customers. One of the poorest customer service of an international company. What a pity. Be careful if you ever want to take Air India. There are options people and we deserve a better deal.,no

The seats were very uncomfortable. The tv screen was hazy and unclear. Entertainment was limited to 5 English movies! The map route was not available and the vegetarian breakfast was disgusting.

Only highlight was access to lounge at HTR airport which was Singapore Airlines lounge. Flight experience - seats are not as comfortable as one would expect in business class. Very old seats with poor cushion. seats in row 1 is very narrow. Flight entertainment did not work so made the flight very noisy. Food was not up to business class standard. Did not get wash bag when flying out, not sure why. Flight from Delhi to London - food was very poor. A menu was supplied only to be told that options on the menu not available. Food tasted poor quality and dry. Airport lounge at Delhi airport was not up to standard - food was limited choice, not enough provisions.

Turned out to be a pretty smooth and comfortable flight. Quick & efficient check-in staff. Plane arrived early, we departed early and reach much before the scheduled arrival time. The cabin crew was courteous and professional. Snacks served were very basic but of good quality. Emphasis was made on covid safety protocols. Baggage reclaim was quick.

(This was on either legs of the flight. BLR-MUM-LHR & the return leg) The company needs to immediately look to upgrade their high traffic/revenue routes for start. Selection of alcohol was pathetic. They're only offering cheap IMFL liquor Sula wine & Blenders Pride. Ballentine though part of selection, was over shortly.

I was flying with my 12 year old son and I had hurt my knee and needed a wheel chair. The food was horrible on the flight. Tasteless food and our television set was not working. We were traveling 14 hours without a TV. The crew tried their level best to reset it but it just would not work. The ground staff at Delhi Airport was just horrible. They have a huge badge that says no tips but since he has to help me from international to Domestic and take my luggage from I decided I would pay him 1000 Rupees which I thought was a fair tip. But he started demanding more money and n dollars. His friends came there too asking what’s the matter.  He told me that he took me their short cuts so he has to share the money thru the official thru. Wow Air India. Your officers don’t get paid that they loot us? Finally he settled for 60$. Why when all other air line employee or for that matter Air India ground staff in the USA won’t demand money why in India do they literally take advantage of you? Shameless.,no

At check-in the staff wanted our vaccine certificate and Airseva app downloaded. This was not known whilst booking or was any email sent prior to the day of departure. This resulted in huge chaos at check-in as lot many didn’t know. The aircraft seats were torn, and dirty, and the handrest and other parts of the seat were held together with fraying masking tape. The cabin partitions and carpet were covered with grime. The flexible arm of the display wouldn’t stand up, and the wired remote was broken and temperamental. The Upma & Vada served for breakfast was undercooked and stale. The bread roll was cold and tough as a rubber pad. Food didn't get any better on the 12-hour flight. Snacks were meagre to non-existent. I have used public urinals, which are cleaner than the toilets on board. The in flight service and cleanliness on this route were much better before the change of ownership.",no
AirIndia,1,"""supposedly too late for boarding""",Vamshi Krishnan,30th September 2022,"Not Verified |  I have been a frequent flier in Air India being a government employee, took a sigh of relief when it got privatised, which meant that I no longer had the compulsion to fly the same. However, against my better judgement I booked a flight from Delhi - Madurai via Chennai on 18 Sep. Reached the airport about an hr and thirty mins early as I was already travelling from Jammu. But due to the overall rush at the entrance and que, reached the counter 55 MINS prior to departure, but to my horror I was refused a ticket as the ‘Wonderful Server of Air India’ didn’t take web checkin and I was supposedly too late for boarding. The same was the case with four more passengers on same flight and even on the request of so many passengers, no body triers to hear the problem or help. the Manager was rude to the hapless passengers.",no
AirIndia,1,"""won't fly Air India again""",Advay Biswal,15th September 2022,"Not Verified |  The worst airline I have ever experienced. The ground staff is very rude.

The seats are very unhygienic, the tray table is also very dirty. After arriving on the airport, it took 30 minutes just for the first bag to come, and when I received mine, it was a bit damaged from the side. Terrible airline, won't fly Air India again.",no
AirIndia,6,"""new ownership is interested in cutting costs""",N Shavun,15th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  The fare was booked at a cheaper fare which was good. The check in process and the ground staff was also good. The boarding started on time. However my experience related to the food and catering has been the opposite. Seems Air India has dropped the ball with regards to the food on board. Previously before it got privatized, they used to provide a full breakfast with tea / coffee as part of it's morning service. This time when I traveled post the takeover, instead of the breakfast, all we got was a sandwich. No beverages at all. Air India's food and catering was always it's strong point even before it got privatized (along with seat pitch and baggage allowance). But it seems that the new ownership is interested in cutting costs and then marketing this as as some sort of ""innovation"" to the gullible flying public. There are so many other aspects of the airline that need to be improved. Instead what the owners have done is turned a strength into a weakness.",yes
AirIndia,1,"""Worst flight I ever had""",Jen Thomas,15th September 2022,"Not Verified |  Worst flight I ever had. I paid money and they even did not provide basic needs. TV was there and it wasn't working, and you can understand how I feel that for a long flight. I asked cabin crews for few things and honestly speaking, restaurant staffs are way more better than them. They were too rude and I became really scared to ask even for a glass of water. Guys, please, we are spending too much money on this airline atleast provide what we deserve. Please do train your staff, please make sure things are working, it is a request.",no
AirIndia,3,"""Leg space was also very small""",Hussain Lokhandwala,15th September 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  They are providing TV but not allowing to use us. In Air india on same day I was travelling in 2 flights in both meals were included but in both they gave us the same meal in which they gave sandwich with a water bottle.

AirIndia,1,""" My seat stopped reclining""",Sahil Malhotra,15th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rock hard seats (even in business), infotainment system worked thankfully, but the movies collection was very limited and from pre 2000 era. The interface was dated and buggy. Food quantity was limited with very poor presentation. I had an onward journey of 2 hours with Vistara on a domestic business, and that food quality/presentation was far better than this 14 hr Air India flight. Typical other issues as expected/noted with this flight. Seats were dirty, and you could see adhesive in various places. My seat stopped reclining mid-way and got stuck in a lie-flat position; I was then moved to another seat, which did not recline at all, and I was forced to be in a sitting position for the remainder journey. The washroom sink was choked towards the latter half of the flight. Feedback/complaint registered on Air India website, but as expected, there is no response (been over 15 days). The only positive of the airline was the cabin crew, who were courteous and polite. Flying economy of AC or one of the ME3 is a better choice than flying business with Air India!",no

The chicken was bone dry,  green beans were raw at the center, the dish was very watery. The rice I was served was very dry and hard, the curry lacking any flavor. The seats didn't recline properly, and were as hard as a rock. The cabin crew was helpful, but unfortunately that's about as far as the positives go. I decided to not fly Air India again.",no
AirIndia,3,"""Air India will certainly be my last option""",Alpa Gandhi,15th September 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely disappointed with in flight entertainment. Mine did not work at all and getting through the long flight was a nightmare. The steward clearly told me that they cannot check each every unit and it is just my bad luck! I am already dreading my return flight after 15 days. Will Air India stay on my list of preferred airlines? Answer is no. Air India will certainly be my last option. Also. one of my bags also came back damaged!,no
AirIndia,1,"""not cleaned since many of the past flights""",Akhilesh Joshi,15th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled from Newark to Delhi on 27 Jun 2022. Welcome onboard by air hostesses was like as they are obliging me by allowing to board the flight. The seat was not fully operational with Digital screen. The handle/bar swivel was not aligned properly. Retractable desk was broken and screws missing and the hinges were with ‘wet’ adhesive. It appeared that they were either just pasted or wrong adhesive was used to stick the broken hinges/ swivel.  When opened the table, I was continuous holding the glass and water bottle, as it was not balanced, they were rolling towards centre. ( No turbulence). There was no connection to plug in the ear phone and the socket was missing. (I picked up ear phone from adjoining vacant seat). International flight of 14 hrs was not provided with sanitizer, face mask, eye mask, dental kit, shaving kit except the dirty throw blanket and pillow.  The newspaper shelves/ behind the front seat were too dirty and full of garbage.  The bulkheads had so many oily spots/ finger spots that they were not cleaned since many of the past flights.  Regarding welcome drinks there was no option other than Orange/ Apple juice or aerated water/ drinks and soda drinks. 1The digital screen had only 6 (classical) and 4 (recent) movies out of which few could not be screened. The map was continuous on “Flight Data not available”. Lunch was just like ‘Rice Plate’ available in Mumbai worth Rs 20/-. The cheapest desert, dried bun, no fruits. The quantity was 4 cubes of Paneer, four pieces of boiled potato and 2-3 spoons of boiled rice.  After serving lunch, the staff did not serve drinks/ water for almost eight hours of flight. Later on approaching to pantry, the staff denied rather expressed their binding to serve on seat.  After nine hours they distribute dry snack pacjets(3) 20gms each without tea/ coffee/drinks or fluid. The overhead lights were on auto mode to switch ON / OFF and the attendance call switches were not working.  The toilets were filthy with no hand soap/ cologne etc. only hand sanitizer of local brand was kept with scarcity of hand tissues.  The second meal was served 2:00 hrs before the destination which contained 4 spoon rice, beans and boiled yellow dal + yogurt and mango pudding as desert. The cutlery items were from the cheapest plastic product and a tissue paper of 4x6 size, that too of the cheapest quality. It’s a disgrace for me to travel with Air India on a premium category international flight.  The hot tea/coffee was served in paper cups of roadside quality which can be bought in market for Rs 25- 100 pieces.",no

Staff were courteous, as it was snack time so only a sandwich with a sweet were provided, same for Mumbai Ahmedabad flight as it was less than an hour flight. At Bhubaneshwar after boarding there were some security reasons (and it was independence day of India) we were deboarded and again have to go through security and also through check of aircraft, this made the schedule delayed and we were on the verge of missing our connecting flight, we contacted commercial staff and they assured that they will try our best to get the connection. When we reached Mumbai it was already boarding time of our connection, just after disembarking we saw a staff who was waiting for us , he escorted till security, before security he changed our (only) boarding pass with a new one which was printed on business class so that we can go through business class security which was like a breeze.

AirIndia,1,"""It was a nightmare for us""",D Baji,20th August 2022,"Not Verified |  The flight was old and everything in it showed ageing. The plastics were cracked, upholstery stained, cushions rock solid, paint peeling. The entertainment screen was not working and when asked the air hostess replied that it’s complaint in almost half of the flight. This happened on our way to and back. This is the first time we are travelling in Air India. In air India even on a £800 ticket (there were 6 of us including a 2yr old, so £4800 in total) you feel poor and wants to get out of it as soon as possible. There were not even a colour pencil to entertain a 2yr old, I shouldn’t be complaining about that, should be glad we even got a seat (not comfortable though) to sit for 8hrs. The food was heavily salted and tasted cheap.  The flights were not on time (affected the transit time, so we had to run from one flight to next) but I not as bad as I heard before, at least Tata taking over has done some good. London via Delhi is not a good idea. When you come from London you need to check out and check in your luggage at Delhi again, so that takes min 2hrs in transit time (not to mention the porters and staff at Delhi trying to scam you) and you will almost miss your next flight of the first one was late to arrive in Delhi.

They keep 3rd class people in there team who knows nothing but to trouble you and make you run.,no
AirIndia,1,"""Worst experience I have ever had""",Mark Wilhite,7th August 2022,Not Verified |  Awful! Worst experience I have ever had. Check in was challenging. I paid a large sum of money for business class. My seat buttons did not work. I had to sit upright the entire 15 hour flight. The only thing I got from flight attendants was “Sorry for the inconvenience.” No wifi. No entertainment. Worn out plane. A rip off! Never again!,no
AirIndia,1,"""not choose this airline""",Deepesh Ganguli,7th August 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am warning others to not choose this airline even if the ticket prices are attractive. You want nothing to do with this type of service. I have been on the phone for a refund for a cancelled flight throughout the last 15 months (flight cancelled in May 2021 and its August 2022) and left numerous feedback forms on the website and all I receive are apology emails that inform me that they are processing the refund as soon as possible. Every last agent tells me they are escalating to some other department. Last contact from their ""ecommerce department"" was on 29 January 2022, after which nothing else. I have tried contacting them after that as well to no avail.",no
AirIndia,2,"""I would not recommend this airline""",K Ankur,7th August 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience flying Air India. The plane from Mumbai to Newark was dilapidated and some of the seats were even broken (they were still assigned to customers). The in-flight entertainment did not work. The flight attendants seemed apathetic to pressing the request assistance button on the seats. The food was just OK. We had terrible experience checking in at the Mumbai airport. The airport manager was rude and would not let me check in my car seat for free which is the law in the US and demanded me to pay extra money for it. He would not listen to my argument that I got it to India for free and this was my return trip back to the US. Only later I showed him that the Air India website listed that car seats travel free that he allowed me to check the car seats for free. I would not recommend this airline to anyone till Air India retrains their staff in customer service and upgrades their airplanes.,no
AirIndia,2,"""a dilapidated and outdated aircraft""",S Harmaj,7th August 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Air India should be ashamed for operating such a dilapidated and outdated aircraft for a 14-hour flight on this sector and charging a premium of almost CAD $2500.00 per ticket for a one-way flight. Their domestic aircrafts are in much better shape. There was a 8 hour delay to begin with. Paid additional price for booking XL seats for extra leg space but to my horror realized that these seats are narrower at the waist in comparison to a normal seat. Broken tray tables with cracks and stains, no inflight entertainment (for the entire duration of the journey) and a nonworking toilet added to our woes. Would the top management of AI fly economy on such an aircraft on a 14 hour flight? The cabin crew were courteous but there was nothing much they could do with regards to the condition of the aircraft.",no

Air con did not work for 45 minutes when we were waiting to take off at 40C in Delhi airport (it worked fine once we were airborne), seats did not recline properly.

AirIndia,1,"""This is the worst airline""",Isha Thakur,7th August 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airline. Also the airhostess were very rude. I booked business class tickets. The seats were completely uncomfortable. I had requested for 1 extra blanket for my back and they refused. The staff member said 1 person will get only one and the staff were using 3 blankets to sleep on the seats. Also they had curtains closed in the middle row. The staff occupied all the seats in the middle row to sleep.  How can the staff sleep in customer area. Business class facilities the staff were using. There is no difference in treatment of economy passengers and business class passengers. Its waste of money. Also one my luggage they had lost and it was international departure. When I claimed I didn’t get any compensation. They are rude and worst airline. The staff is very unprofessional.,no
AirIndia,2,"""It was a horror show""",D Meares,7th August 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Thinking of an Air India flight with long stopover in Delhi? It was a horror show. Yes a 19hr stop allows for multi-hour delays (ours was 4.75 late leaving Sydney so they boarded us just before they'd have to give compensation, to sit there) If you book a hotel and organise a transit e-visa for those hours their bureaucracy will likely have a complete meltdown. The transit official confiscated my next boarding pass. (I had to argue to retrieve my bag tag, which was a good thing as I suddenly noticed my bag hadn’t been transferred as promised). The delay meant I'd missed the last train, then I couldn’t get back into the terminal till a few hours before departure without the boarding pass. Then the bureaucracy to get a new boarding pass was Kafkaesque since I was already checked in. No infection control wipes on the plane, 2 special meals didn’t arrive, entertainment on one side of the 1st plane was broken, the air filter on the 2nd chockablock plane looked disgusting; and clueless checkin agents were too busy insisting on printouts of things like 2nd vaccination shots (though I had printouts confirming my 3rd) to tell you that unusual items like drone cameras will be confiscated from your hand luggage during the transit x-ray. No other airlines have this policy, and mine was summarily confiscated in Delhi ""you can't take things that fly on the aeroplane"" — seriously; that was their rationale! Nice flight attendants Sydney to Delhi though & 33” legroom was the only redeeming feature. Lastly, unforgivably, I discovered they fly right over the Russian war zone that other airlines avoid, whilst using Russian oil bought cheaply by India sidestepping embargos. French airport staff were so incensed at this that they gave the plane the very last aerobridge and the very furthermost baggage carousel from that, a punishing 30 minute walk between. So your legs pay a price in addition to your conscience.",no
AirIndia,7,"""I am severely disappointed""",E Han,9th July 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a window seat, and the person in the middle seat next to me had a broken screen. Nothing was done, so I just told him that I would watch a movie and let him use my screen after my movie. Midway through the flight, I was really cold, and it took me 20 minutes to call the attention of the flight attendants. The call button was not working, so I tried flashing my light from my cell phone, but nobody was minding me. Eventually, the person in the aisle seat in the same row took the initiative to inform the cabin crew to give me a blanket. Unfortunately, all blankets had already run out. The good news is that the person next to me shared his blanket with me. Also, after being served peanuts, the captain made an announcement that all passengers had to put their masks back on; however, the cabin crew was not implementing this. I have had a terrible sore throat for over a week now. I just wish Air India would take the health and comfort of the customers more seriously. In addition to this, my seat and table were not exactly very clean (see attached photos). As a Star Alliance Member, I am severely disappointed.",yes

The total journey was roughly 10 hours and surprisingly had a pleasant experience. Likes: Legroom - Had better legroom compared to other airlines - Food - provided food in both the flights which is not an option with most other airlines - Well behaved staff - On time baggage availability - Value for money - Use of minimal plastic cutlery Dislikes - There should have been an entertainment system at least in the international flights.

Once we were able to board our flight after many difficulties this airline caused, we were disgusted. The mould lining the windows and the seats was unhygienic enough but the movies screen were cracked and unusable .. only very few worked and when they did they were extremely difficult to operate. We received 1 water over a 12 hour flight and the food they provided us with was mid. Flew with both my parents and a friend of mine and we requested seats together, well at least for my friend and I because we're nervous on planes. They were unable to do that for us and we all sat in completely different seats ... when we made a complaint and tried to switch seats they kept dismissing us. I most certainly wouldn't choose to fly with Air India.",no
AirIndia,1,"""relates to my lost luggage""",A Kajay,9th July 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Onboard the flights i have found several times their screens do not work, this also applies in Business Class. One might think its a fault so they'll ignore it or maybe only that particular aircraft has the issue but sadly not. I have found this issue continuously. My negative review with Air India really relates to my lost luggage. There are no words to explain the misery i went through with Air India in trying to retrieve my bag. At Heathrow I was given a P.I.R (Property Regularity Report and a ""authority to claim delayed baggage"" form which i filled in. Alongside this I was told my bag would be back within 3-5 days and was given a online tracking link. In this luggage i had items that could never be retrieved back for example wedding photos dating back over 100 years of my great grandparents, this is just one example. I wrote several emails to Air India and although i had responses none of them answered my question. All responses were exactly the same (standard) giving me different links. Furthermore i made several calls to them to which none were answered. After 6 days the online tracking stated the bag was found and loaded onto a Air India flight back to Heathrow. The bag never arrived. I only came to know this by ringing in so many times and not just one day but over several days - basically my mornings were wasted This happened four times. It is only when i built up a decent relationship at Heathrow with the person dealing with delayed baggage to send a strong email internally. I called everyday probably more than 50 times and be lucky if my call was answered. When the bag eventually arrived after 15 days i requested that i will collect it - a travel distance of 120 miles from where i live to Heathrow. I got to Heathrow (to get in to the baggage area is another story) and opened up my bag to find many things missing.  Thankfully some of the missing items were located (thanks to the gentleman at Heathrow who understood my situation) at Delhi airport. They advised they wouldn't post it and someone had to collect it. With the connections i have there i was able to retrieve majority of my items, however without the connections i would have had to travel to Delhi and no doubt would have been harassed. In my opinion Air India has the potential of becoming a superior airline but the mentality of certain staff members who handle luggage really lets the airline down. I have seen more negative reviews for Air India than positive ones and its about time that i wake up and don't ignore them but rather take them on board.",no

Their staff members are rude and unprofessional. After flight booking I found first name and initials are jumbled up in the ticket, so I called customer support but its hours long wait time, then I tried US number which was picked up by a rude person who couldn't communicate in English or Hindi either, there was no resolution over the call. Before take-off safety demo was not performed which is mandatory as per aviation laws, cabin announcements were made in a very feeble tone that no one was able to understand. Landing was very hard on touchdown. After landing our luggage was not present on announced baggage belt, hence we checked with Air India ground staff but instead of helping that person responded rudely that he is not concerned with anyone's luggage and we should find our missing bags ourselves over the airport. The airline was managed by Indian government earlier, as usual govt employees have no interest in doing work, rather they prefer to get free salaries as govt jobs are secure by default, hence the entire crew is affected by this laziness disease.

After challenging it and asking to be rebooked to another flight they said there was nothing they could do. When we showed up at the service counter, they told us that we were late for our flight which simply was not true. The flight was indeed overbooked.

AirIndia,1,"""first and last Air India experience""",Amandeep Singh,21st May 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was very disappointed by bad client service experience from Delhi airport by Air India team. First thing first was at baggage register counter was full with a lot of peoples because at the same G counter there was not just Paris flight register counter it was with Paris, New York , Toronto flight baggage counter . So there was a lot of rush it took us 2 hours to register our bags. And when we reach at counter the lady took almost 30 minutes to print our boarding passes . Then it took us 1 hours to complete the immigration process. We asked Air India employee to help us to speed up the immigration but he said we can't do anything then when we finished the security check. And ran towards our gate air India employee call us to come fast to boarding gate. We said we are coming but they did not wait for us for 5 min and can't let us in. We missed our flight. After that when i ask air India employee to help us but they were not helping us a lot.  I asked them to at least give me tickets for next flight because it was not my fault. But they said its completely your fault and we can't do anything for you. My wife was ill. she beg to your employees to at least help us in something but there was nothing from them. I asked to give us tickets for next flight but they said sir you have to pay 500€ extra for that tickets. Not a refund Not a coupon to eat something between the waiting time to get our bags. Not a single penny refunded and they are asking for 500 € We paid 500€ because we need to start our jobs.

AirIndia,1,"""only 10% of the screens started working""",Freny Zaveri,21st May 2022,"Not Verified |  Before you call AI Customer service - grab tons of patience and few hours in hand to get through the whole process. You need to call AI customer service number which is not trained at all for any customer service. Not even basic greetings. The rep is talking to you and behind you hear a supervisor shouting at staff constantly. Couple of times I asked the representative if everything is ok there and lady responded that it is usual. Once you have your basic itinerary ready, they will transfer you to billing department which can take only AMEX or Visa card. They do have few other options like net banking, Indian credit cards etc. When you are ready to pay AI, representative will send you a link where you can authorize the payment - 90% of the time that doesn't work. With that link your reservation is secure for 4 hours, so you keep on trying to pay. Then I put my Credit card information and my India address which is not connected to my credit card and magic happened. My payment was accepted and here I am wondering will that be a fraud inquiry from my credit card company. Finally, after all this I had a ticket to travel. Before the flight I updated our food preferences and all the passport and global entry information. The website will save the information but when you go next time to check your information that is gone so you need to add that all over again. BTW they don’t have separate line for TSA APPROVE either on the airport. It is one common line at Newark Airport (EWR). Finally, we settled in the flight and after takeoff it was time for the first meal. The air hostess came and said there was only 1 request for a child's meal so unfortunately, we don't have an extra child's meal. I am glad my older one eats a little spicy food so I convinced her to eat a regular meal so that my younger one could eat a meal. I had reconfirmed on the website as well as on the call multiple times about our food preferences but still no luck. The flight was Boeing 777 (OLD) plane which has no Wi-Fi. Everyone gets their personal screen in front of the seat but most of them were not working. The whole flight complained so they restarted the whole system. After that only 10% of the screens started working. Now on a 14 hour long flight you don't have Wi-Fi or screen. The people who already downloaded from home are very smart. In short, have plenty of downloads so you can kill 14 hours on flight. Finally, we made it to India and felt now everything will be fine, but my misery continued while coming back from Vadodara to Newark. As we reached Vadodara airport, all looks good, easy going, all documents verified and here I am waiting at the counter to get my boarding pass so we can head to lounge. The rep is saying - Mam, all boarding pass issued for both flights except yours, so we need to issue handwritten boarding pass. Did he say had written boarding pass, I was like no one will believe this is a valid document and security won't let me pass. The AI rep is no mam, it happens sometimes, and they know. You please go ahead. As I reached to security line and handed over my boarding pass, the officer was looking at me as though I am an alien and had I issued a handwritten pass to myself. AI supposed to inform Airport security about this so I can have easy transition but knowing AI they didn't bother to inform the security. When I said firmly that it's between AI and Airport security finally AI security showed up and resolved the issue.",no

We reported this to the service counter for Air India in the  Delhi airport before 5pm. Approximately an hour later they told us they found our tablet and it was in their possession there at Delhi Airport. However, they refused to give it to us as it was no longer between the hours of 9 to 5. I explained to the woman that we were flying out that evening and couldn't return in the morning as we arrived back in the states in the morning. I even asked if I could pay to have it shipped to me in the states. She said she couldn't help us and then grabbed her purse and left without telling us what to do next or how to proceed. Then once I returned to the states there was no one working the Air India counter but a very nice woman gave me a phone number to call. I called the Air India number and the customer service agent said he can’t help me and that I had to call the Delhi Service desk (the same one that wouldn’t help me when I was standing there, and this same desk that had my computer and refused to hand it to me). I told him I couldn’t afford to call Delhi and that I needed his help and he kept saying no, call the airport and then he hung up on me. We called and emailed numerous times and it has been a month and still nothing. The plane was terrible, seats had no cushions and no room. None of the TVs worked and there was no WIFI ... made for a long 17hr flight. The flight crew were rude and wouldn't let us look out the windows except at specified times even though we were flying over the Himalayas and I wanted to see them. When boarding Delhi to the States you have to go through a second security checkpoint at the gate before you board (full xray scan and everything). The machine was malfunctioning and so they made all 400 of us stand in line waiting for an hour while they figured out they had to plug it in and we took off late because of it.

AirIndia,1,"""left stranded with very little options""",S Kamalaya,30th April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight route was from Washington DC IAD to Bengaluru via Delhi on 27th April ‘22. The scheduled stopover was 2.5 hours in which we had to complete immigration, check out baggage , go through customs and re-check in baggage and finally do the security check before boarding the second flight to Bengaluru. There was a delay of approx 45 mins by the time the flight landed in Delhi. So we had roughly only about 1.5 hours to complete the above steps. Unfortunately, although we were able to finish all the required steps by 1:30 pm, which was the scheduled departure time, we found to our dismay at the gate that the flight had taken off. What followed after that was a very difficult situation for any international traveller. We are a family of 4 carrying 9 checkin items along with carryon items. We received very little to no guidance or help from the airline officials. We were exited out of the airport, which meant we had to start all over again as a domestic passenger carrying international luggage. We had to run from post to pillar to arrange for new tickets as AirIndia has told us there were no other seats available on that day to Bengaluru. The next available flight was at a very hefty price on the next day evening. We were told it was our fault to have not boarded the flight in time and so there was no compensation or any willingness to try to look for options to accommodate us. We even requested them to provide us the lounge facility if we bought the next evening tickets at exorbitant price (27K per ticket). They’ve denied even giving that to us. We were left stranded with very little options. We stayed at the airport all day looking for options. Fortunately we were able to book through another airlines and discovered that there is a cargo service which offered to transport our luggage at a reasonable rate. Please use cargo option if you’re ever stranded with international luggage. We finally reached Bengaluru around 2:30 AM. Ironically, this flight was delayed by one and half hours since some of the passengers could not board this flight in time due to delayed Srinagar flight. Glad this airline was willing to accommodate them despite such a delay. I fail to understand why Air India could not have waited for a few minutes more despite our checked in luggage! In all, we ended spending 70K for tickets and cargo for no fault of ours. Did Air India sell our tickets to others, what could be the reason?  Immigration  Priority should be given to the passengers based on their transit flight timings. You might end up last in the long line based on your seating position when you get out from your first flight. Baggage claim: Based on your family/group, it will take that much more time to get all your luggage identified and out. We lost a lot of time here. There was still luggage coming out on the carousel after we identified our luggage.  Customs and Check in luggage: While checking in luggage we had to battle through a big line amidst angry domestic travellers. There should be two different lines for domestic and international travellers while checking in the luggage. We lost a lot of time here. Security check: Again, domestic and international passengers need to have different lines. Travellers who were unable to board in spite of checking in their luggage should be accommodated in another flight without having them completely exited.",no

A crew member was very rude & disrespectful . I was feeling cold in the aircraft & had requested her to give me a blanket. She didn’t pay any attention to what I had said & ignored completely. After an hour i had reminded her about it & she didn’t listen to me. I reminded her while serving food the third time & still no courtesy to reply back. While serving drinks she forgot to hand me over my drink & moved on. I had to stop her & literally request to serve me my drink. She didn’t even bother to apologize. She was very unprofessional with no smile.,no

Sitender from Air India security and Pooja morning shift for going above and beyond to help my mother in law for assisting her to board a flight to Australia.

Baggage check-in person was extremely rude. My bag did not arrive when I arrived. The phone# and email that I received from the baggage claim form is useless. Air India do not value their customers. No one will follow up regarding missing bags. After 50 phone calls and numerous emails with no response, we ended up going back at the airport three times, finally we had some luck with meeting with supervisor. After one long week, we received the bag. No compensation was provided for the troubles that we went through. It was the worst experience from our last travel. Every encounter we had, not one person made us feel that they cared. I am very disappointed with my travel experience.",no

This was my first experience after Tata had taken over Air India and this was the worst experience I ever had with an airline. The interior of the flight was quite old looking, passenger hand rest were broken and wrapped with insulation tape. Moreover, the seat was torn and dirty. I don’t want to mention anything about toilet cleanliness. Food quality was pathetic, quality came down drastically, not at all tasty.",no
AirIndia,1,"""One of the worst experiences""",J Havawin,4th April 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  One of the worst experiences of my life in flying. The ground staff was rude and did not know how to handle edge cases. I got sick due to extreme heat and on requesting priority check-in it was provided but the experience is worst than normal check-in. The duty Manager was rude and did not handle it well even on explaining the health condition. The Inflight experience was also not good. Food was stale (Breakfast and Lunch). The flight attendants were also not courteous and did not come to attend to the passenger (me) even 2 hrs after calling. InFlight entertainment was also not working. Seems flight attendants are there for sake of being there not for service. Better go for any other Airline.,no

Except for on-schedule flights, nothing seems to have changed under the new ownership. No entertainment system available and even the flight attendants seemed unaware. Then the lame excuse - ""our entertainment system is getting updated under new ownership"". We didn't even bother to try the entertainment system on any further leg. The Priority tags on the luggage were the biggest jokes, except at Heathrow, almost everywhere, we got our luggage almost at the end. During our return, we had a 4 hours wait at Delhi Intl. terminal and there was no lounge facility available. I would have expected them to have an arrangements with other airlines or providers. I feel, it will take time for Air India to change its archaic and unprofessional model.",no

AirIndia,1,"""Never again Air India in my life""",Joseph Cherian,4th April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  As I entered the Air India aircraft (Boeing 777) there was no fresh smell but a sensation of stale air. During the 15-hour flight, none of the tv screens was working. The announcement was made over the public address system that the tv screens were faulty, for which they apologized.  AC too may not have been working because the air was humid and stuffy. None of the cabin crew came around offering water or other services.  Throughout the flight, people were walking up and down the aisle to fetch water. For lunch they also included the snack meant for tea, so crew can be spared the trouble of serving again at tea time. The flight was so deplorable that I cancelled my return trip to Vancouver by Air India and booked on Lufthansa instead, even though I had to lose a substantial amount of money. Never again Air India in my life.",no
AirIndia,1,"""a totally chaotic experience""",C Kathir,4th April 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  It was a totally chaotic experience. No web check in from Vancouver as it is not in the drop down list.I called customer service and the poor lady could not help me much. The flight is totally basic. No inflight entertainment whatsoever. The seats are broken and dirty. No reading light or call button. Thankfully I was forewarned so I had downloaded movies for kids on their computers. I had booked seats with more leg space but despite me paying extra for this I did not get the chosen seats. This was frustrating. Nor will I get repaid for the extra fare I paid as now I dont have time to run after them. The heating system was overworking and the aircraft was boiling. When I asked staff to lower the temperature they were giving weird explanations that we are flying over north pole and temperature outside is minus 60. Finally one of them told me the aircraft is old and their was a technical glitch. The thermostat was not working. The saving grace was that most of the staff was hospitable and felt embarrassed by the poor quality aircraft themselves. They commiserated with us as they were not responsible for the poor quality provided by AI. The lady next to me helped me with my frustrated tired kids. On the whole I would not recommend this flight. New management has a huge task ahead of them.,no
AirIndia,5,"""the food was the worst I’ve ever had""",Jay Gupta,4th April 2022,"Not Verified |  I realize that Tatas have a huge task ahead of them to set the airline on a proper trajectory.

The seats were super uncomfortable. Most of the TVs did not work. The staff was extremely rude and did their job horribly. When I complained about the TV not working, they did nothing to help. The overhead lights and assistance buttons also did not work. When I asked for water, they told me to go to the back and get it myself. The bathrooms were disgusting. No toilet paper or hand sanitizer. Travellers were not even provided basic toiletries like toothbrushes and toothpaste even though it was a 16 hour flight. I will never be travelling on this airline again and do not recommend anyone else to either!",no
AirIndia,1,"""an alternative flight was also not arranged""",N Singh,4th April 2022,✅ Trip Verified | Our flight was cancelled at 12.30 when all customers were waiting for boarding which is unacceptable and an alternative flight was also not arranged which is completely zero tolerance.

AirIndia,3,"""most mediocre Business class""",A Sahyra,4th April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled in AI 309 Melbourne to New Delhi. It’s one of the most mediocre Business classes I ever travelled in. It is more like glorified Premium Economy. Some airlines premium economy is better than business class of Air India.  Enough Legroom and comfortable but Zero privacy to the extent you must share the table with the person sitting next to you. No storage whatsoever. Charging points not working. If you chose the windows seat, then then you must literally jump over the aisle seat person if they are sleeping. Inflight Entertainment: The inflight entertainment is laughable. If you are not Indian, you will have like 10 movies to chose from. TV shows have only one episode. No music to listen to. Food: Its typical Indian food be prepared for that. Service: They server two meals and a round of drinks of your choice. You will be asked for drinks twice only. Cost: it was slightly cheaper than other business class when I say slightly 1200AUD less than other flights. And I chose it, which is clearly a mistake. Will not recommend this carrier.",no
AirIndia,1,"""doesn't care in the least about customer service""",C Thane,4th April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am horrified! I've never been treated so badly in my entire life! I showed up for my flight 3 hours early. When I went to check in, I was asked if I had filled out the Air Suvidha form. I had not, as I had not been notified by Air India that this form was required, and I looked all over their website and found no mention of this form. I have been to India 4 times before and knew to have all my pertinent documents with me, which I did, but nobody told me I had to upload them to a special website. Filling out the form was impossible to do on a cell phone, I couldn't get the documents to be small enough, so the form kept being rejected. There was nobody there helping all the people who had not filled out the form because none of them were notified in advance. There were a half dozen of us that were not permitted to check in because we were unable to complete the form on our cell phones, among those turned away were an elderly couple and a young couple with an infant baby. This is totally unconscionable! The couple with the infant baby asked if they could at least be compensated with a hotel room, and the heartless Air India employee behind the counter said, sorry there is nothing we can do for you. Then to add insult to injury, when trying to rebook the flight, Air India is charging a $300 no show fee. This airline doesn't care in the least about customer service. I will never book a flight with Air India again. Do yourself a favor and book with a different airline.",no

AirIndia,1,"""sublime torture on this 15.5 hour journey""",S Shetty,13th March 2022,"Not Verified |  I have often heard of horror stories of international travel in Air India but had thankfully never had to personally experience the airline on an international route. However due to a personal emergency, I had to fly Air India recently since it was the only way I could get to Chicago in time. Air India has elevated the art of flying into a sublime torture on this 15.5 hour journey. The tortuous check-in process with agents taking upto 15-20 minutes to check-in a single passenger and the general chaos at the counter in Delhi was a precursor to the horrors which awaited me on board. The aircraft was run-down and shabby, which was the second warning but the best part was when I reached my seat, I had an exit row aisle right next to the bathroom which was so narrow that I could barely wedge myself in the seat with the the ancient inflight entertainment remote bulging out and pressing into my waist. Of course this fun was enhanced by the fact that in the entire economy section not more than 4-5 seats had a working IFE system the rest of us were entertained by staring at the Air India logo on the screen for 15 hours and they even gave us complimentary headsets so that we could enjoy the feel of the cheap headsets in our ears since the system was not working anyway, The seat itself had a worn out cushion and a weird back angle and barely usable headrests, I have never been happier to exit an aircraft just so that I never have to sit in this seat again. This was not the end of it of course, the airline decided that since the flight was scheduled at an ungodly hour of 2.45 am, it makes no sense to offer food to passengers who after traveling to the airport and spending an awesome time in check-in and immigration would just not be in the mood for sustenance so they dropped some chips and a packet of cheap biscuits on the seat and served breakfast only after 5-6 hours at least hunger made the awful food more edible. After this the crew decided to rest for 6-7 hours just handing out a cup of tea in between and while theoretically we could go to the galley to make our own tea/coffee they very considerately did not keep any cups or disposable paper cups to consume the said tea/coffee in. Perhaps a game of find the cup could entertain the passengers since the IFE could not. Finally a couple of hours before landing we were offered dinner which tasted slightly better than wet cardboard. The only redeeming factor on the flight was that Air India is surprisingly generous with alcohol and still offers good whisky and gin in good portion in economy but since this was only served to the end of the flight, it did not alleviate the misery in any way. The first thing I did after reaching my destination was to cancel my return ticket with them since there is no way I can put myself through such an experience again.",no
AirIndia,1,"""No entertainment on 16 hr flight""",P Vardel,13th March 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst flight I travelled ever. My flight was of 16 hrs non stop and the screen in front of me was not working at all I was not able to watch any safety protocols or see where the flight is currently, route, weather conditions. No entertainment on the 16 hrs flight. It felt like I was in a black hole or something like that. I requested the flight attendants to turn the screen on or change the seat if the screen is broken and they responded in humiliating and disrespectful way and did nothing.  If the screen was not working why did you allotted the seat to me, it was very unfair with me.",no

The armrest was broken as shown in the photo here. They have screen but earphones don’t work. I asked for a cup of tea I was told we are serving food right now so later will bring it, after an hour I went again n was told sorry now we can’t give you anything as we will land in one hour and we forgot to bring before.

I have try calling AI since last three days no answer. If you try to book the flight the calls goes through immediately but if you call for any other reason no one ever picks up. I have submitted an online feedback no respond. I have sent an email no response. We were told by the crew member that since she had an issue with her seat she would get a refund back, but how will one get a refund if there is no way to contact anyone?

AirIndia,1,"""plane was filthy,  entertainment non existent""",Anisha Judge,13th March 2022,"Not Verified |  I had booked a business class ticket using miles for travel from San Francisco to Delhi on Feb 21st. The ticket was booked and a seat was assigned 2 months prior to travel. I knew that there was something amiss when I tried to check in 24 hours prior to departure as it kept asking me to contact an agent. Of course true to Air India’s style there was no way to get through to an agent. When I arrived at the airport and presented my confirmed ticket to the agent she without any explanation called her manager. This is where the rudeness and complete disregard started. The staff who is supposed to be a supervisor came and without a greeting or an apology states “you have 2 options, you can take a non working seat in business class or move to economy.”  When I said that neither of those options were acceptable she responded with “then I cant help you as I have to give your seat to a paying passenger” and in the same breath asked the agent to take the next passenger with no resolution to my situation or problem. When I refused to move she basically moved the agent to another desk and started talking to the next passenger, completely ignoring me as if I did not exist. I kept talking and she completely ignored me. I was also informed that she was the only manager and that I had no recourse. Imagine standing at the airport with a ticket in hand and no airline employee willing to do their job and get you checked in. I then walked over to the united counter to try to see if I could fly united – unfortunately the united flight had just closed so that option was lost to me. I explained my situation to the united manager, who then contacted Air India. At this time I realized that their staff had lied to me and that there was a manager higher than her on site. It took the involvement of another airline’s manager to bring the until now invisible Air India manager out of her office. She stepped in and informed me that the business class seat that they were willing to reassign me to (not my original seat) was manually functional ie. broken but could be moved manually. I had no choice but to accept this less than ideal offer. When I got on board, I did ask the flight attendant to check that the seat was indeed manually functional. At this time the ground staff reentered the plane and interrupted my conversation with the flight attendant by screaming in front of all the other passengers “I have spent 1 hour with this woman and told her that the seat is broken.” She was curtailed from continuing this rant by the flight supervisor and passengers sitting in 14A and 14C.  Anyway it so turned out that the seat was completely broken. They finally moved me to another partially broken seat. This seat required manual adjustment and even manually the foot rest would not come into complete upright position so essentially the FAA rules were broken during take off and landing. Finally the plane was filthy, the entertainment non existent and the food terrible. Anyway I made my way to Delhi in complete misery.",no

However, I did expect to see changes in the Soft Product like Ground staff, Cabin Crew, Inflight meals and most Importantly the On Time Performance. I was very impressed with the overall time management of the ground staff who ensured on time boarding. The Cabin crew was courteous and ensured that all the pax wore masks for the entire duration of the flight. Air India offers free refreshments or meals on a short 60 Minute flight like this one so I was served a refreshment box with a veg puff, tetra juice pack, Tomato ketchup and and the crew was kind enough to serve me another snack box when I requested. Overall it was a great short flight and would fly them again.",yes

They don't provide pillow and blankets, they don't serve soft drinks, hard drink, tea or coffee on seat. You have to go the service station, sometime passengers don't know and they wait all the time for drinks. Like me and didn't announce that. For snacks they serve that 10rupees bread cold sandwich and  breakfast quality is ok. When you ask them for these things they give excuse of COVID.

I arranged to pay but they asked to see the negative report of the new test. When I brought the report I was told now the change fee had increased to 4500 rupees. In desperation, I agreed but was told they would only change the flight after I brought the luggage that was checked on the earlier flight. I got my luggage and as expected the counter staff of Air India told me now the change fee had become 7000 rupees.

I tried booking online from Australia and everytime the payment failed. Then I tried booking via the tickets via their 24 hrs helpline and I had to call their call center multiple times for a total duration of 5 hrs before I could finally book the tickets. For every call, the Call center agent verifies the details again and then transfers the call to the ticketing team for booking, cancellations, rescheduling and refunds. But then the call gets disconnected invariably after 30 mins. I faced this same issue when I tried to reschedule my return domestic flight as my original flight was cancelled. Why can we not access the direct line to the ticketing team when are actually choosing that option while calling the call center? I think this is the biggest pain, please fix this. I will not prefer to travel with Air India unless I am in a pinch. Online booking and Call center delays are the biggest two issues which will keep the customer away, so please fix this.",no

Had to do so at the time of check in to ensure that the United frequent flyer was printed on the Boarding Pass. Air India should ensure that any Star Alliance number can be inserted into the booking. Check-In Almost trouble free - the staff at Toronto was diligent in verifying vaccination status and RT-PCR test results. Staff must be trained to insert the Frequent Flyer number from other star alliance airlines. Boarding delay and nothing but chaos! There was no separate queue for business class. The counter was surrounded by passengers and the boarding was not started at the scheduled time. Smooth flight, great Boeing 777  and great meals! However, after the first 2 hours, the toilets were not looked after and supplies were not re-stocked. Extraordinary courtesy by cabin crew, very helpful to the families with kids and senior citizens. Air India Lounge at Delhi airport with very little supplies and hardly any variety of food. Cramped space during the pandemic. I flew from Delhi to Mumbai after the 14 hour flight from Toronto to Delhi. It was another chaotic boarding with 1 person at the boarding point and a lot of interference by Air India non-flying crew members as they tried to get best seats for themselves and their family members having passes. My own business class seat was changed in favor of a Captain's daughter flying on the flight.

Calls to generic customer support lines that can be found online either don't work or connect to someone who cannot help after waiting for long periods. The specific phone numbers I received to the team handling my case at Goa airport do not answer to my calls or messages (even confirmed that they do answer when called from a different number, so I strongly suspect them of ignoring my specific phone number). At this point it has been almost two weeks since losing my bag, and a week since I last managed to get through to Air India (despite daily attempts to do so). In short this experience with customer service is extremely frustrating, and having to deal with them has made my trip much worse than it had to be without luggage. Apart from not having much confidence in Air India trying to return my luggage to me, my attempts to get compensated for (1) additional expenses made for new clothing and toiletries and (2) for the value of the bag if not found after 21 days has been frustrating as well. I was instructed at the airport to send my receipts to an email address specific to the Goa team, after which my case would get updated with them and I'd retrieve the compensation by picking it up in cash at any global Air India office. Unsurprisingly I have not heard back on this email address after a week, and even if the compensation would have been honored in my case the idea of having to physically go to an office after I leave India is bonkers. In my many desperate attempts to get any sign of life on my case from Air India the only place where they have been sort of responsive is through Twitter, but even they do not seem to be able to get an update from the luggage team actually handling my case. Concluding, I would advise everyone to avoid Air India at all cost as any circumstance in which you'd have to deal with their customer support will be extremely frustrating. While I would expect non-budget national carriers and Star Alliance members offer some basic level of service, this is not at all the case for Air India.",no
AirIndia,1,"""worst experience with this airline""",Lilesh Karade,2nd December 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Recently I traveled with Air India and experienced a worst experience with this airline. We were travelling from Mumbai to Goa and due to congestion in traffic it almost took us 2 hrs for travelling a distance of 8 KM to Terminal 2. The flight was at 9 PM and we reached at the desk at 8.15 PM. The Air India Personnel rudely told that we cannot be allowed to board the flight as we are late and have not done the web check in. It was surprising that though we had done the web check in it was not showing on their portal. Later I have checked with many passengers who informed me that the Airline Portal always had some issues while web check in and though you complete web check in it will not show in their portal. Finally, all the personnel to whoever I spoke instead of helping me out from this situation was blatantly blaming me for my delay in reaching the airport, and made sure that I should not board in the flight. Another harassment started when I went to the booking office to book the tickets for another flight of Air India. The booking officer on other side of the glass/window was asking me to speak loudly as he was not able to hear my requests made. I kept on shouting and informed him of my desire to book a tickets to Goa. He somehow understood my requests and started browsing the portal for five minutes and got up to make some phone calls. I asked him what is happening ? to which he replied that he is enquiring with his superiors for booking tickets. After five minutes I lost my patience and left the window. Secondly, their call centres are closed after 18:00 Hrs. A recorded message will be heard continuously after 18:00 HRs that you are in queue, but no one will respond from the other side nor the IVR facility will be available. I travelled with Indigo so many times but the way they help me out during the distress is commendable. In similar situation at Chandigarh airport when I reached just before 30 minutes of scheduled flight, they made sure that I boarded in the flight with my family. Their personnel accompanied me from entrance of the airport up to the flight. Now I can understand why this airline is in losses from so many years. The attitude of the staff is sinking this boat.",no
AirIndia,1,"""the worst experience""",Manav Joshi,2nd December 2021,"Flight departure time was 11.55am which was delayed to 1.55pm. Passengers were allowed to board flight at 1pm. Pilot found some technical issue at the last moment and could not be fixed in 9 hours. It is 9.15pm, I am still on the flight which has not taken off. Passengers were provided a meal once only and status updates were not given frequently which left people clueless and frustrated. In terms of interior, seats can't be pushed back more than an inch, screens not functioning properly, provided meal was also tasteless. Overall the worst experience. When I asked an attendant to provide water, she said it was kept in the galley, get it from there. Blanket and cushion is not provided in flight.

The Airport ground crew of Air India, stopped me and said we can not travel to USA as my infant child is holding Canadian passport and so she can't travel USA without valid B1/B2 VISA. They didn't even know that Canadian passport holders gets on arrival visa to enter USA. When I showed both of them the proof of USA & Canadian federal website and rules about the same that Canadian passport holders are allowed to travel USA and get on arrival visa. That supervisor told me ""people can write anything in their website, so we don't consider federal website as a proof"" I was shocked knowing they were not aware about the rule. When my travel agent directly contact to higher authorities from Air India and explained that they are wrong, I was issued board passes after 2 hours of harassment by Air India. The aircraft was so dirty and unhygienic to even fly. This was very old aircraft and there was food stuck in side the TV remote and all inside the seat corners.

I have to use my own lap to eat the food. I have asked for Non-Veg, as I have already eaten Veg first time - Flight attendant answer - Sorry no options and Veg is the only option. My next seat customer has got the Non-Veg after some heated discussion, still no luck for me.  Seat recliner push-button broken hence can not push back. Flight attendant response - Cant do anything, we will check and sort this in London.

It's the first shock, reached airport leaving all my day plans. Later the flight started around 4.00pm. One more shock on the plane is its via Kolhapur. In a very bad mood we reached Kolhapur at 5.40pm, its suppose to leave by 5.50pm, the Kolhapur staff were informed by the airline staff that they have to take off on or before 5.50pm. Again it got delayed and the flight was not started till 6.15pm. Suddenly an announcement that the flight can't take off due to bad weather when we can see the stars and the moon clearly. So many people had connecting flights to travel abroad. They have given back our luggage and not said anything. I waited till 8.30pm with no update, at least on next day timings.

AirIndia,2,"""the most disappointing experience""",N Shah Jenkins,2nd December 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had my first experience with Air India recently, and I have to say it has been up there as possibly the most disappointing experience I have ever had. In summary, if you have a choice - please choose another proper airline. This was a flight long haul from London to Bombay. The ticket was booked in economy and upgraded to Business Class using FR miles. Prior to flying I needed to contact customer services and this was a nightmare. I wasted hours of my time trying to call them. I managed to get through to one person, who when I explained the problem just shouted back what’s the problem, what’s the problem. Then he put me on hold and a different man who was more well spoken answered and then lied to me that he was going to arrange a video call back in 2h. Very confusing that he would say that, and not try to help me, and not collect any of my personal details. I never did receive any support and when calling back the telephone queue was like a prank call, with the queue position going up and down like a yo-yo. Shocking, beyond terrible but the worst part is those lies from customer services, that really damages Air India’s credibility with me. Anyway I went to the airport, I was concerned about extra check during COVID times so I arrived 3.5 hours before departure. Air India refused to allow me to check in early, despite the Business Counter being in use by economy passengers. Now I know I was early, so partially my fault. However at one stage other BOM passengers were being allowed to join the economy queue while I had to wait for be allowed to go to the Business Class check-in. By the time I checked in, there was one BOM economy passenger I recognised that reached the counter before me. Business Class is meant to be a premium product to take the hassle and stress out of travelling, or add a little luxury. I travel in economy for personal travel about 99% of the time, as we all have bills to pay. However when I upgrade to business class, I expect to enjoy it and see the benefit. After this ordeal I was able to enjoy at the lounge facilities at London Heathrow, luckily it was a Star Alliance lounge run by another airline, phew! I’m glad it wasn’t an Air India lounge, lest I would be subjected to further torture. At the boarding gate more fun and games I’m afraid. One giant mess of a queue to have temperature readings before going to the boarding desk. This meant there was no discernible difference between economy and business class passengers, just one big line to wait in. More stress and hassle which was supposed to be avoided. On the plane, as expected a tired cabin, outdated infotainment. The seat was comfortable but lacking some adjustment options. The infotainment screen was low resolution, and difficult to use compared with modern equivalents on proper airlines such as Etihad. The Business Class cabin is what you would expect on a shorter haul flight, such as 4-5h, not a 9+h flight. I will write a complaint to Air India. I don’t expect to receive anything back.",no
AirIndia,2,"""Services have downgraded tremendously""",Jyoti Kumari,24th October 2021,✅ Trip Verified | Services have downgraded tremendously. They made all the passengers sit in the flight for about 30-40 mins without switching on the Air Conditioner. When customers asked they did nothing about it. People were using papers to fan themselves. The flight didn’t take off on time or land on time. My seat was also changed post boarding while entering the flight manually without my consent like it was a local train.

We had to attend function and that's why we took early flight so that we reach on time. We missed our function and also lost all our mood to attend function.

At the time of check in we requested the ground staff to provide a better seat to at least the baby and the mother if not anyone else. But they did not cooperate. The air India website is so so poor. This is the first airline in which there was no choice of choosing a seat during web check in. I have traveled so many times before, each airline gives you a chance to choose the seats but that wasn't the case with this airline. Rather we got the last seat of the airline i.e., the seat near the washroom. It was smelling so bad and there was no one to listen to us. Again while coming back from GOA the same thing happened. The same seats were allotted. I called on their customer care and for like 25 minutes no one picked up the call. After 25 mins one of the customer care executive picked up the call and she was so rude. She said i am transferring the call but nothing happened after that I tried calling them again and then there was no response from their side. While calling the Air India customer care even if u are in a queue, your wait time and queue position keeps on increasing instead of coming down.

On the plane, when I raised the issue, the cabin crew and counter staff failed to rectify the situation. They then moved me to a demonstrably worse seat, one without a TV, which all other passengers had. Mind you, this was for a 15-hour flight. I understand that people sometimes need to have their seats shifted, but surely there were others on the plane who hadn't paid for their seats, so their seats should be changed, not those of us who paid for our seating.

So now why are we allowed to book the tickets when the flights are not flying at all. Secondly the systems at Air India Customer care are not at all updated and they have no idea or update of the current status of the flights. We would have called at least 10 times and every time they mentioned flight is confirmed and later after several transfer to escalation team and all we get to know that flights are not flying. Now at maharaja we got the update that the flight is not flying, however it is a scam and trying to fool people as till yesterday in maharaja It was showing out name and details for the particular flight but today is says it is cancelled. Are the website and customer care people not aware of the current status or are they doing it knowingly to collect money from people and not refund it.Its a big scam going on that too when Indian government is involved. Now when we call for refund we are directed to several teams on the call on long waits and no one is able to give a proper solution. Not sure if we will ever get the money back. Really frustrated, along with that we also did the RTPCR test which cost around 600$ for 3 of us. we had given several calls before going for the test just to be sure and conformed and the Customer care guys mentioned it is confirmed.

I called several times after that and I got the same response:  I'd have to pay the $200 cancellation charge because the 24 hours has passed. Otherwise, they said its wise to hold off on cancelling until my escalated case would be reviewed by someone at a higher level. That the customer agents do not have access to emails because they just dont and only the backend team can see my emails That I'd get a response within 24 to 48 hours (but didnt).

Check-in and boarding were smooth. They served good food on time, however, did not serve any drinks (coffee/tea/ alcohol). It was at the back of the airlines for self-service. Cabin crews were good to help. The most disastrous incident was not working og inflight entertainment. I just can not imagine that time how to pass nearly 14 hrs without any entertainment. I would download some movies/ songs if I knew earlier. Air India does not provide inflight internet. In most of the seats, inflight entertainment system was not working. Touch screens are hardly working. On the second leg (Delhi to Kolkata), it was of approx 2hrs flight without any inflight entertainment/internet service. Also, the air conditioning was not properly working on the ground. It was very suffocating after wearing mask and face shield. Air India is one of the two domestic airlines that provide hot meals. But they serve the only veg meal. The meals were so so.",no

AirIndia,4,"""the product is really sub par""",R Pardolan,17th June 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  After avoiding Air India for years, I was forced to spend my hard earned money on them for a round trip between IAD and MAA because of the Indian government forbidding sixth freedom traffic under the covid air bubble agreements. I had very low expectations, and Air India was as bad as I feared. The Indian government should get out of the business of running an airline as soon as possible. Every aspect of this trip was subpar, and given a choice, I cannot imaging why anybody would ever travel on this airline. Here are all the ways in which they were bad: 1) Their web site is terrible, and it wouldn't accept my Lufthansa frequent flyer number, even though there is a section for entering partner airlines membership numbers. The web site also wouldn't allow me to request a special meal, and it gave absolutely no explanation for why. From some google research, I realized this might be due to covid precautions 2) I made 2 separate calls to their customer service center to try and address the above issues. The amount of background noise during both calls made it seem like their reps were sitting in the middle of New Delhi railway station for their calls. I could barely hear or understand what the reps were saying. They supposedly entered my Lufthansa number for me, but as I could tell when I printed my boarding pass, it wasn't entered properly, and it didn't work. I had to claim my miles via Lufthansa after the flight On a separate call, the rep took my special meal request and entered it, but didn't seem to know, or didn't bother to tell me that special meals were not possible during Covid 3) My itinerary was IAD-DEL-MAA, on different B787s for each leg. I flew business class, and the product is really sub par. The seats are grimy, the upholstery was torn on one of the legs, the seat power didn't work properly. Worst of all for me, the moving maps didn't work on both IAD-DEL and DEL-IAD legs. Also, the flat bed isn't long enough for my 6'3"" height. The pillow they give is a joke. The cabin crew were nice enough, but I really didn't like the heavy/greasy Indian food I was forced to eat on some of the legs. The food on the MAA-DEL leg even gave me severe digestion problems. 4) Air India lounges were open in DEL or MAA, supposedly due to Covid, but other private lounges were operating, so it seems like Covid was just an excuse. 5) On a couple positive notes, all my flights were on time, which was a blessing, and the prices of the business class ticket was well below pre-pandemic business class levels.",no

The check in and baggage drop was quick and easy. The load on this flight was on the lighter side and so as a result the flight was by and large very uneventful. Boarding also started well ahead of time and as far as the inflight service was concerned, only a drink was provided. The arrival and baggage collection was also done swiftly.

I don’t Mind giving the amount if it’s the rule and is legit. The desk person let go a girl without even weighing her carry on telling her, why do you want to weigh it, if you can lift it, that means it’s not that’s heavy, and the same guy charged me around Rs 600 per kg.

The Air India staff from Delhi did not let me fly even when I had a valid PCR report with me. They were so rude and they stopped me from boarding telling that they need to verify my result. The supervisor at the Delhi Airport was being so irresponsible and later was not clearly saying anything about why I'm not eligible to travel. Then he later apologized and told me he will book one ticket for me the next day.  I stayed there from 1 am in the morning to 11 am talking to everyone in Air India asking about this issue. No one responded in a good way and even was laughing at me. The supervisors are even worse with no responsibility. They even took back my boarding pass from Delhi to Toronto to take away the proof.

Also when doing the web check in, I was also surprised to see that the system was unable to recognize the PNR which was quite strange, however the mobile check in was successful and even though the timing of the flight was uncertain, just 1 day before the departure, the airline provided a confirmation of the flight timings via SMS. The baggage drop and ground process was quick and smooth. Boarding was on schedule and the departure was also slightly delayed by 15 mins due to the air show in Bangalore. However the crew made up for the time en-route. The airline has also resumed full meal service and lunch was provided which was a welcome addition. The meal was good and nice and we landed 5 minutes ahead of schedule which was good. The web check in experience could have been better and also the rescheduling was not exactly welcome but the inflight experience was quite nice and the crew was very good in looking after the passengers.

AirIndia,1,"""Such a terrible airline""",Eliza Kento,14th March 2021,"Not Verified |  I booked the ticket for my parents from Assam to Bangalore via Kolkata as there were no direct flight available on the particular date and i booked it only on the basis of the waiting period which was very less compared to the other flights. However on the day the flight which was suppose to take off at 8:30 and reach Bengaluru by max 3pm on the same day took off at 11 from Assam which is understandable because it can get quite foggy during winter. But after reaching Kolkata there was no information or any message from the airline regarding the delayed flight to Bengaluru. My dad has a chronic kidney disease and its difficult to travel for long hour and moreover they are not frequent flyers. Not even a single staff from air India passed any kind of information and on enquiry they simply raised their eyebrow with that arrogant attitude. I wonder what they are so proud of I just wish i had their names. The airline completely forgot their customer. Such a terrible airline. There is more to it, so the flight was delayed from Kolkata to Bengaluru via Hyderabad again by LEGIT 11hr which was also unsure of.

Completely disgusted with my experience. After a year of chasing Air India for a refund due to a flight that they cancelled, I have yet to receive a single cent. I did not even find out about the cancellation until after I arrived to the airport and was informed at the check in counter. Apparently they tried to call me once and I didn't pick up. No email notification, nor text...nothing. Several emails went by without a response. For months I waited, repeatedly calling customer service, until I received an email saying they would only issue a refund when things returned ""to normalcy."" Now it has been 12 months. Half of the time you call their number, you will get a message saying it's the wrong number. The other half of the time it won't go through at all. When you finally reach them, you receive service from staff so incompetent it's obvious they were not even given basic training of how to look up information in their system. You feel sorry for them as they fumble around. I won't even blame the call center staff, as it's obvious the responsibility lies on the complete negligence of the Air India management to run an efficient operation. Why are airlines allowed to get away with this behavior? Any other business would have been shut down a long time ago.

I want to complain about staff in Dubai airport, no professionalism and talking in a regional language. At least give a strict order to your international staff to talk in English.

If they don’t have space they should clearly state that only shoulder bags are allowed in cabin.

I request airline authorities to come up with a drill to instruct the passengers in regards of few body movements for blood circulation at these moments of delayed flights or long hours of waiting inside the capsule.

The delay not only disrupted my travel plans but also resulted in additional expenses. I had made arrangements based on the original arrival time, which had to be hastily adjusted due to the unforeseen delay.

Crew are very intelligent & keeping a toilet separately for them by simply locking it from outside. None of the crew follow basic covid-19 protocol, no one wears mask.  2 triangle shaped (half of bread) with very salty cheese & local made sweet bun, approx.100ml/200ml water served.

I was flying on Air India Express from Doha to Cochin on Feb 24, 2022. At the check in counter at Hamad International Airport, I encountered the most rude staff ever. On showing my full vaccination certificate (Covishield from India with QR code), they claimed this is not the right certificate, since it only showed the date of second dose, not the first dose. (Isn't it obvious I have taken the first dose if second dose is valid?) Also, in my certificate printout, our PM Modi's picture was not printed clearly and they raised an issue stating 'where is Modi's picture? This is not authentic'. Does the airline really validate vaccination certificates based on Modi's photo rather than the valid QR code right next to it? When I tried to explain that I travelled to Doha 2 months earlier with the same certificate and had no issue, the staff told me not to argue and would not even bother listening to me. He demanded I show him the date of first dose or I cannot board the flight. Luckily, I had my laptop with me and I could access the first dose certificate in a couple of minutes. But the basis on how Air India Express staff check vaccination certificates and the way they speak to their customers is absolutely pathetic and inhumane.

That's the bare minimum you need to do. Secondly, what sort of a money-making business are you in? Can't provide a wheelchair for free to an elderly passenger who really needs it?

Rescheduling or refund request (even after deduction) not possible online, still in bullock-cart era, they claim that it is a government company unlike private agencies, they have rules to comply.

If you are lucky enough and get through, then after the interrogation, they will send a link where you have to pay the difference in charge, then after the payment again you have to call for rescheduling.

None of the flight attendants answered any of the call bells or any of the questions which the passengers have. The Capt made one PA which wasn't followed by any updates. The PA said it would be a delay of 10-15 mins and now it's over an hour and half. Finally caught a flight attendant to inform them about my connection flight to which his response was that the ground staff would deal with it, worst part is that I would be stuck at the airport because of their incompetence for more than 12 hrs which is unacceptable. I don't understand how the printing of load sheet manually takes this long as I fly a 380 aircraft and have had incidents of system crashing and have never taken this long. This is plain and simple incompetence and laziness on their part and nothing else. They are not professional at all and no wonder they would not be surviving for too long.

The start - flight was precisely 1 hour late on 11th Jan 19 (AI9002). Was quite patient with the waiting time. Then it all started. Here’s the list of flaws: Poor hygiene in the washroom. No head napkin/hygiene cloth on top of the seat (absolutely unacceptable. Dinner - a nightmare and I must elaborate with complete respect by saying management is least bothered with regards to the quality of food, no expiry date label on the food (how could you do that. It’s simply criminal). Asked the staff and all that they have to say is “It’s our standard”. I replied “ It’s my right to know the manufacturing date and the date of expiration”. Eyebrows up and rolling eyes is all I got. Staff looked helpless as they had no answer and hid themselves behind the curtain and never came out to clarify further. It’s my right to have a great experience leave beside the money paid for the ticket. I do not expect a Qatar Airways service but at least please try and get close to them to make all happy who chooses you. Take customers seriously please.

This caused inconvenience to me and a lot of other passengers who were traveling ahead. Second, the ground staff was only shouting at passengers at Dubai airport to keep away and no explanation for the delay. In the meantime the flight further delayed by an hour.

Worst airline with worst attention and customer service by crew to ground staff and even customer care. Finally they took my whole money to re schedule or cancellation. Worst airline in my life.,no
Air India Express,1,Air India Express customer review,M Valsek,5th July 2018,✅ Trip Verified |  I was travelling from Madurai to Singapore with my Wife and three kids (Twin infants and toddler). The crew offered no help. Me and my wife were struggling to keep the hand luggage inside the cabin.  Luckily one of the passenger after watching all this helped us to keep our luggage inside the cabin. Such a poor experience with Air India express. I dont understand why they have such a helpless and inhumane crew members.,no
Air India Express,2,"""air conditioning wasn't working""",Karthikeyan Jeyaseelan,5th July 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Chennai. Worst flight, No leg space, worst seats. Nothing is proper.

The seat cushion wasn't any more, windows and seats all were broken, air conditioning wasn't working.",no
Air India Express,1,"""Never fly Air India Express""",E Lanse,5th July 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the worst experience from Sharjah to Trivandrum with Air India Express IX-536 on 21/12/2017. My flight was scheduled to be at 20.40 hrs from Sharjah but the departure was at 6.30 am next morning. But had a delay of 9 hours and 40 minutes. They keep on rescheduling and keep on sending text messages and we're made to wait for flight. Overall I would say. This flight not at all suitable for emergency and we'll planned trips. Never fly with Air India Express, you're never sure to arrive on time. This is completely unrespectful and not honest at all.",no
Air India Express,3,"""entire cabin wasn't in good condition""",R Mendonca,5th July 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Check in was extremely chaotic at both Mumbai to Sharjah. I was only checked in 1hr before departure in spite of arriving 2.5 hrs early at BOM. Air India handles Air India express check in at BOM and they were not helpful at all, more like clueless on how to handle the check in. Was hoping to at least fly on one of the newer planes. Unfortunately, on both sectors (BOM-SHJ & return), I flew on the older ones. Bringing positives in view first: Cabin Crew on both flights surprisingly stood out. All 4 or them were helpful in every way. Always received a ""Your Welcome"" when I thanked them. Another plus was the small snack box, consisting of juice, few snacks & a water bottle. Tea and coffee service was also done with refills provided, which was really nice. The crew were more than willing to offer one more snack box if requested. The seat was alright. However, coming to the negatives, the entire cabin wasn't in good condition. It gave a very old feeling. The washrooms did not have any lighting inside and it was dark if you had to use it. Overall, I would not recommend to fly with this airline as, they need to improve all areas from start to end to better the passenger experience. The crew are the only people who stand out.",no
Air India Express,1,"""Worst airline ever""",B Hallir,5th July 2018,✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Chennai. Worst airline ever. Old plane bad seats. Extremely rude staff.

Air India Express,1,"""Their flight delays very often""",Mohammed Asif Mansoori,28th October 2017,✅ Verified Review |  Sharjah to Mumbai. Air India Express is less concerned about customer importance. Their flight delays very often. Never had any issue with other airlines but this one is very risky. They keep on rescheduling and keep on sending text messages and we're made to wait for flight. Overall I would say. This flight not at all suitable for emergency and we'll planned trips.,no
Air India Express,10,"""young and efficient crew""",Jordan Saldanha,28th October 2017,✅ Verified Review |  My trip from Dubai to Mumbai was excellent. The flight was on time got my luggage in Mumbai on time. They had a young and efficient crew. The snacks provided were fresh and water was provided free (this is a budget airline). Dubai to Mumbai flight alcohol was served at a very reasonable cost. Return flight no Alcohol served don't know why? My return flight was delayed because of bad weather condition. I was notified on time which helped me spend 3 hours more with my family. The journey was pleasant and safe helping me have a enjoyable holiday.,yes
Air India Express,1,"""the worst experience""",C Lameure,28th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  This was the worst experience from Calicut to Cochin with Air India Express. However, our flight of 45 min from Calicut to Cochin had a delay of 3 hours for no explicite reason except technical aspects, and we missed our 2 next flights with different airlines. Despite explaining the situation to 5 different people, nothing was done to help us, no refund or help to find new flights.  Never fly with Air India Express, you're never sure to arrive on time.

Air India Express,4,"""regret this decision forever""",Sanjeev Gupta,28th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  We travelled on Ar India Express for the first time on the trip from Delhi to Dubai return in September this year. I will regret this decision forever. To start with, the airconditioning was not working when we boarded the plane. That made it difficult to sit even for 10 minutes inside the plane. We shuddered at the thought of spending the 3.5  hour flight sweating. Thankfully the airconditioning started once we were airborne and reached a satisfactory level in about half an hour. We were seated in the row just before the emergency exits. The pushback buttons had been crudely taken out of our seats to prevent us from pushing the seats back. There was an inflight audio entertainment system in each seat but was not functional. One could see broken edges of seat arms, window sealings etc. all over the plane. The inflight staff did not have a groomed look, the meals provided were just passable. It was the same story on the return flight. Taken a vow to never fly with Air India Express again. Word of advice: not to be confused with Air India which is definitely a better service.",no

Later when I reached airport, they informed the flight is delayed by 4 hours. Since I had connected flight from Chennai to Coimbatore at 6.30 on 4th Feb, I requested for assistance of staff in Kuala Lumpur - they took my data of connecting flights and promised me that alternative connecting flights will be arranged and informed to Officials in Chennai. But flight took only at 5 am on 4th Feb and it landed at 6.30 am in Chennai airport. My connecting flight had already departed the airport. When I required the Air India staff, they ran away as their duty is over and no one was there in the airport. Never seen such an experience in my life. I have to book a new connecting flight and flew to Coimbatore.",no
Air India Express,2,"""the flight was not enjoyable""",Shaleel Kesavan,28th October 2017,"The check-in staff at Trivandrum airport were excellent. However the flight was not enjoyable. The meal was basic. The cost was not actually that much lower than the other airlines. The seats were a dingy red leather. Although the staff appeared to be attentive, they did not look enthused at all. On landing at Abu Dhabi, some passengers decided to get up from their seat before the plane had reached a complete stop. They stood up while the plane was moving and the cabin staff did nothing to get them back into their seat. In my many years of travel, I had never seen this before.",no
Air India Express,3,Air India Express customer review,Rajan Bulchand,28th October 2017,"Took this flight because of convenient timing. Check in was smooth. Surprisingly they started boarding early, more than 1 hour before flight time. Plane was only 3 minutes from the terminal. We got to the plane and thee was no AC, temperature outside was over 40 degrees Celsius (Dubai in July). Passengers were getting very restless and children were crying due to heat. They had us on the plane for a very long time and we ended up leaving late, so more than 1 hour on the plane. AC only went on properly 15 minutes after take off. The aircraft was very very old and dirty. Flight was smooth and crew was friendly. They need to use newer planes, or reconsider. People use this because of timing and non-stop route to Pune. I think if there were better option no one would go on it.",no
Air India Express,9,Air India Express customer review,Mohammed Nazeer,28th October 2017,I used travelled Air India Express back in September on AUH-COK-AUH sector. The fare was pretty much the best compared to other airlines. AUH-COK took off on time and with only less than 50 passengers on board due to off- season. The crew were pleasant and helpful. They provided snacks and even I got 3 bottles of water extra upon request. On the return the flight was almost full. Good service on time departure on both segments. Surprisingly there was not any IFE screens there. After describing the security and safety instructions the screens were turned off and folded back to the berth!,yes
Air India Express,8,Air India Express customer review,Sanjay Modak,28th October 2017,This is a summary of several flights I have taken on AIX on the Dubai-Pune-Dubai route. These flights were at a very convenient time during the day. Now they have been shifted to the early hours of the morning which makes it less convenient though still better than driving BOM-PNQ-BOM. All the flights I have taken so far have been smooth and excellent - take-offs landings and en route. Service is generally excellent and they surprisingly serve a small snack with unlimited water. I have invariably requested and obtained emergency exit seats with ample legroom. Toilets are clean again surprisingly but smell a bit. The main thing that needs to be improved is the maintenance of the cabin. The carpets are worn and the leather seats need refurbishing. The interior of these 738 aircraft need a good scrubbing. But other than that AIX does well on this route.,yes
Air India Express,3,Air India Express customer review,Shlok Misra,28th October 2017,Flew from Dubai to Lucknow and back to Dubai. The crew seemed bored and the service was horrible. The table was broken and the meal served was inedible. The toilets were dirty. The seats were uncomfortable which made spending those hours on the aircraft unbearable. Choosing Air India Express was a poor choice in spite of the low cost tag attached to it.,no
Air India Express,1,Air India Express customer review,Harsh Gidwani,12th October 2014,Apart from having point to point connection there is nothing else that this airline can offer. I flew from Dubai to Amritsar and back and found this trip rather exhausting and uncomfortable due to the airline service. Being a budget carrier does mean to save costs but its doesn't mean to keep your aircraft's dirty and unhygienic. When I entered the aircraft both the times I felt as I am traveling in one of those public buses which are disposed for public use (to be honest even public buses are well maintained that Air India Express aircraft's) the crew looked angry for no reason it felt as if they were punished to come here and serve us they did not have the decency to speak politely with passengers and just dumped their frustration on us. Food was awful as everything looked stale and had no taste. Since this was the only flight available for me to reach Amritsar I was forced to take it.,no
Air India Express,1,Air India Express customer review,Siddharth Ghaisas,12th October 2014,Booked Dubai-Pune-Dubai in Jan 2014 however had to change the Dubai-Pune leg of the journey. My return journey (Pune-Dubai) was a nightmare. On arriving at the airport in the early hours of the morning I realized that my flight had been delayed for reasons unknown/unannounced to me. Then delayed 40 minutes in the security check line because other domestic flights need to be released earlier. After much delay I arrive at the final gate only to see no information displayed about my flight. Its delayed further. No one at any counter to enquire for any information. Felt relieved when the announcement to board was being made but there was more to come we were made to sit inside the aircraft as the pilots did not have clearance from ATC. It turned out to be for an hour or more until we finally were given clearance to fly. So a trip which I chose on purpose to save time and money did everything else but those two things.,no
Air India Express,7,Air India Express customer review,M Rajeev,12th October 2014,Flew Pune to Dubai and back. Flight was on time in both legs. Seat quality could have been improved. No common inflight entertainment too as airline fell short of earphones for passengers so did not distribute any. Snacks were served but were unhealthy (deep fried). Air hostesses had a stern look through the journey. Cost of ticket was very less as compared to full service carriers.,yes
Air India Express,8,Air India Express customer review,Jiju Joseph,12th October 2014,Traveled SHJ-COK-SHJ last month. I have selected this flight because the holiday season started and IX was the cheapest available from UAE to Kochi. After my disastrous trip by Air India last month on the same sector I was not expecting much from IX but I should admit that I was surprised. Nice and clean aircraft with enough legroom polite cabin crew who were attending the passengers with a smile and on time take off and landing was part of the surprise package. And all these were for half the price of the next available airline.,yes
Air India Express,6,Air India Express customer review,S Modak,12th October 2014,"DXB-PNQ-DXB. Check in was smooth at DXB T2 and I managed to get 1C. The plane from the inside looked a bit shabby as most AI aircraft somehow do but I was happy for the extra legroom for my 6'3"" frame. A very overweight couple took seats 1A and B after smiling sheepishly at me. The man was overflowing into my seat. I saw that 1D was empty and moved over. AIX served a flimsy cardboard box containing a sandwich a small packet of banana chips something fried and inedible and a muffin. Strange assortment but better than nothing and welcome on a low cost carrier. Unlimited water as well. Drinks are chargeable. Flight left about 30 minutes late but arriving into PNQ was a breeze and I was home in 10 minutes after leaving the airport. Check-in in PNQ for the return leg was chaotic as usual and the woman insisted my bags were overweight. I smiled a lot and finally after I removed my laptop from my hand luggage she let me go through and even gave me a reclining exit row seat. The seat bottom was worn out and the metal bar kept poking my rear. When I asked for a blanket (even a used blanket) I was told they had run out of them. I avoided serious long term damage to my tailbone by moving and shifting through the flight. Same food was served on this leg. Overall it was good value for money. But basic maintenance a word missing in India's lexicon could be better. Sitting on metal for 3 hours is no fun.",yes
Air India Express,4,Air India Express customer review,Rohit Fernandes,12th October 2014,DXB-IXE. Boarded with apprehension but quite pleasantly surprised. Reasonably clean aircraft pleasant crew and food! Not bad for a budget airline and way better than Air India (the so called full service airline). Have flown them a couple of times again on the same sector.,no
Air India Express,3,Air India Express customer review,M Haridas,12th October 2014,I am regular passenger in UAE-Kerala route. Flights seems to be fairly reasonable compared to the fare structure and clean. Crew helpful. But the snacks to be supplied as per the timing. On mid night flights supplying banana chips and cakes really upset the stomach. Any toasted bread sandwiches (veg or non-veg) would be more ideal which will not add up the cost to the airlines. The fare calculation methods seems strange. Sometimes a person buying an online ticket far earlier before 1 or two months pays more than someone take it on the day or previous day of the flight. Also the taxes calculation. More basic fare is with less tax and vice versa. Recently the cancellation charges have been increased to 35% which is really unbearable. It should be reversed to 10% before 10 days and 15% prior to 24 hrs at least.,no
Air India Express,4,Air India Express customer review,Souk Lan Lim,12th October 2014,Singapore to Calcutta return. An adequate performance from this budget carrier. The flights were on time the comfort was adequate and the staff generally reasonably friendly. The only slight downside was the quality of food offered in the snackbox - barely edible pastries and deep fried cookies. However the flight is only about 4 hours so having little to eat wasn't a big problem. The tickets were 50% cheaper than the only other carrier to offer non-stop flights on this route (Singapore Air) so overall I was extremely pleased with Air India Express.,no
Air India Express,3,Air India Express customer review,Ramanathan Krishnan,12th October 2014,TRZ to KUL via Chennai return. The aircraft was relatively clean on both sectors. Since this was the only flight to Trichy from Kuala Lumpur I thought it would be more practical to just take this flight since there is no hassle of getting out into Chennai. However the transit procedure in Chennai is terrible. We had to get on bus queue up till everyone got off the plane and go though security check again. For the price you pay the service is not at all worthwhile.,no
Air India Express,4,Air India Express customer review,P Bhaduri,12th October 2014,I paid INR 13000 on IX flight from Kolkata to Singapore compared to about 21000 in SQ. The aircraft was clean crew reasonably friendly. They served snacks on the flight. I would say if they keep the aircraft clean and maintains time it's good value for money. I would have to fly few more times to see if they are reliable!,no

Go First,1,"""there is no sense of professionalism in the staff""",M Reddy,2nd May 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Delaying flights by 5-6 hrs and changing the boarding gates multiple times without any formal communication is the USP of this airline. To top it, there is no sense of professionalism in the staff. They do not seem to care about the passengers at all. While people are waiting to get their luggage checked in 6-7 rows long queues, they would be busy gossiping and staring at the wall. For my last flight from Bangalore, I literally stood at the counter for 10 minutes asking the guy to return my phone and I'd post taking the details and verifying my identification [Not even kidding, he was staring at his colleagues and not doing a thing.] Did not bother to answer my question about a security restricted item or mention the gate number. Then, I was called back at the virtual security check for the same question I inquired earlier. Had to rush back to get it verified and cleared only to know that the flight is delayed yet again without any formal communication. This is not the first occurrence. I had to go through a similar ordeal while travelling from Delhi to Srinagar in October last year where they delayed the flight by half a day, changed the boarding gate 3 times and of course, with no formal communication and passengers trying to figure out any information about the flight without the staff. I understand there are unavoidable glitches at times and there are uncertainties with every airline but there is a way of dealing with it and there's a limit of tolerating this kind of attitude. I am forced to write this review because it isn't just a couple of instances with me. I have heard similar encounters with multiple folks now. This is beyond frustrating.",no

After waiting for long they informed that it is further delayed by 40 minutes. Then after 40 minutes they had no clue weather it is departing or not. It is then scheduled for 3:00 am next day.

Go First,8,"""don’t expect to be pampered""",S Hayle,2nd May 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  After booking this ticket I read the reviews for this airline which are pretty negative, especially about delays. So I monitored my flight in the fortnight before my trip. Of the 14 flights only twice did it go on time, but 10 of the flights the delay was only between 20 & 35 minutes. Once it was just over an hour and once it was 5 hours! Go First is a low cost airline so don’t expect to be pampered. You will be herded on at the airport. They also maximise the usage of the airplane so if it’s delayed on the first flight of the day (say fog at Delhi) then all of its flights for that day will be delayed. So I suggest if you need to be somewhere at a particular time (meeting, wedding, flight connection) then maybe look elsewhere. However if it doesn’t matter too much if you arrive an hour or so late at your destination then use them. The plane was clean, crew courteous, a reasonable choice of purchase food/drinks were available and I would use them again.",yes

Dear Airline- Why do you guys cut the airline charges for the flight which is canceled by your end? And you are not bothered about passengers' safety, as delaying by your side made me land late at night and I was traveling alone, I had another journey after landing in Nagpur. Since initially the flight timing was at 6 pm which was going to reach Nagpur by 7.30 pm and was very feasible for me but you delayed it so long and so many times is such a bad service you guys give.

The airport staffs were so rude they refused to take my luggage. So i waited there for few hours and finally my luggage was taken with rudeness. When I thought it was all over it was just the beginning of a worst nightmare. After waiting for few hours I got to know our flight was again delayed by 50 mins. We kept on waiting and just when we thought they will begin the boarding they said the gate no. Has been changes from gate 4 to gate 2! I was already so late and now even frustrated with everything. During the flight the hostesses were so inhospitable, they were very annoyed when other passengers were calling them for help. They were so rude and impolite and surely were unaware of the word kindness. When we were deboarding I couldn't reach my hands to my cabin bag as it had slid inside and I was struggling to get it i asked the hostess to help me with it who was just few feet away standing.

More over when I tried to complain to the Go First staff, instead admitting and finding the solution they were telling me, this is not happened by them and can't do anything. This is not oil stains and we don't know how and where your luggage get messed up.

When I checked the rescheduled time Gofirst has provided me a very unrealistic connection flight time in such a way that my first flight will reach Mumbai five minutes after the second flight departure from Mumbai. When I contacted their customer care they didn't even provide any solution. So I asked them if i can cancel the first flight and board second flight from Mumbai. Then they denied it saying flight is overbooked (The flight which I have already booked with full payment). The same flight available online with a higher amount at same time. When I questioned it they said they will consider my partial cancellation but still they haven't get back on the refund status.

Pathetic service. Worst experience ever. I won't recommend to take this airline, it's worth avoiding. I was traveling with my family from Bangalore to Pune. They rescheduled my flight 4 times on a same day, even when we reached airport (2hrs before) they rescheduled it again in the last moment by 45 minutes delay. Poor management. Person on the ticket counter said you don't need hardcopy of boarding pass, I was travelling with my 7 months old son, they said you don't need a separate boarding pass for him it's mentioned on his mother boarding paas as infant. But when we reached checking place they asked me to go and bring the separate boarding paas. They should train their employees properly before placing on live counter, it's not onjob training. I have to again travel back to ticket counter, again follow the line and then returned. Waste of time and Bangalore airport is a big one you have to travel a lot. When we reached Pune, we went to get our luggage on the luggage belt. We found our new red big suitcase turned into black with some substance all over it. When we asked on help desk, they bring the 'Go First' representative. He was so rude & arrogant, he said it's common, and it's not our responsibility. It is just dust, I asked him to clean up if it's only the dust then he replied it's not our responsibility to take care of ur luggage, you may complaint or write a feedback or check the policy online.

It all started with unorganised boarding with people pushing against each other with no sense of social distancing. Then there was an un-announced delay. Flight was supposed to take off by 21.45 IST but didn't and then came a shocker of an announcement only a good 45 mins later that - there has been a technical malfunction with the plane. I had to demand to be made aware of the exact issue and only then was I informed of the pilot's windscreen fogging.  But the real surprise was their audacity to not let the passengers know of the exact issue.  I was plainly told that there is nothing that can be done and was given a choice to walk out of the plane without any refund or care for accommodation.

I begged them for a closest airport option (namely flying me to Mumbai). They declined that. Then I begged them to halt me in Delhi for a night at my own expense since long travel with a baby is difficult. They even declined that.

Later when returning back from destination I wanted make some changes in my schedule so I contacted them again for that.

And for the BLR - MLE flight, they have rescheduled it as per their needs and convenience. The direct flight was changed to one stop flight.  I had to buy tickets at a higher price from other airlines as I can't afford to miss my trip. This has caused me so much of financial stress and emotional trauma. These guys cancel your flights at the last minute quoting operational reasons. I tried calling them for about 8-10 times. When you call them, Call doesn't get connect and few representatives just hung up your call without helping you while other representatives put you on hold for infinite time without providing a resolution.

Go First,1,"""Never taking this airline ever again""",N Lasari,21st March 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely pathetic. I had booked a flight in this airline for the first time and I expected service as I have experienced from the other airlines before. I understand it is mandatory to web check-in before taking flight but the way these guys at go first make it requires you to pay extra for seat selection, which also can't be skipped if you are checking in the night before.. at the time I had tried, the only available seats cost upwards of 900 rupees. I found this really extortionate as I had booked my tickets well in advance to make an economical trip and it didn't make sense for me to end up paying more for it after all. When i arrived at the airport, i was about 40 mins before the scheduled flight take off. The lady at the counter refused to check me in because I hadn't web checked in. There were two companions travelling with me who happened to arrive at the airport just a little earlier than me and even they hadn't done web check-in and they were being denied boarding pass but after a long argument they were able to get the boarding passes for themselves and they were made to pay extra for that. But I was left behind even though there clearly was more than sufficient time to let me in as I didn't even need to check in any luggage. I just needed my boarding pass and i even offered to pay extra for it but they just blankly refused and escorted me out the airport on the level where i couldn't even ask a cab to come pick me as it was at the departure drop off at Chandigarh airport. Imagine my frustration here and all this while I was trying to figure out how to rejoin my travel companions. Researched flights on that day the prices were astronomical and absolutely unaffordable! My point at the end, i accept i reached a few minutes late at the airport, but the web-checkin process is designed to extort more money and it's absolutely unfair and no passenger should have to pay extra for the flight. They say first 100 seats are free. Like should this be a lucky draw? It's ridiculous! Never taking this airline ever again I'm appalled.",no

This increased our flying time from 2 hours to 9 hours. Incorrectly informed by CSR that we need an RTPCR test, while I had checked on website that it was not needed. Despite my insistence that it was not needed, they said it was. So had to pay $225 to get the RTPCR tests for me and my family. Ultimately it turned out that it was not needed. Pathetic customer service. All they can say is 'sorry for the inconvenience, but we cannot do anything. Please email a complaint'. Even senior GoFirst officials at the airport say the same thing. No assistance to customers at airports. You are essentially left to fend for yourself. They charge for seats in addition to your ticket cost. This is not informed while booking tickets. So be wary of the 'cheap' tickets - there is a hidden cost.",no
Go First,1,"""unprofessional and rude ground staff""",Sruthi Kolla,21st March 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  Most unprofessional and rude ground staff. The flight has been rescheduled N number of times for which we had to completely replan our journey. I wouldn’t travel for free in this airline.,no
Go First,1,"""they changed the schedule rendering the entire journey useless""",S Reddy,21st March 2022,✅ Trip Verified | Go First flight was booked through and through for a return journey and we had to cancel all the legs of the journey. Can't trust any of its flight remote or otherwise to fly on time on schedule hence I am going to opt out of booking on this flight going forth as there are better flights available at nearly the same or comparable prices as offered by Go First. The reschedule or managing the booking via call center is not that easy either but I believe same is the case probably with all airlines. Also we needed to know if we can continue at least on the second leg of the journey and not utilize the first leg on our own cost on same PNR. This query took a lot of digging from their end and finally they allowed it. After allowing it they changed the schedule rendering the entire journey useless.,no
Go First,7,"""Overall the flight was okay""",H Shavun,21st March 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  The fares for this particular sector were on the cheaper side and therefore as I had to visit Mumbai I had gone ahead with the booking for this flight however I was also not sure of what to expect with the airline as there were many complaints and also reviews stating that safety norms were not followed and also recently there was a deluge of flight cancellations with the airline. Closer to my travel journey my original flight got cancelled due to which they had allotted me an earlier flight which did cause a slight change in plans but not much. The online check in process was smooth however at the airport for the baggage drop the queues were quite long and the process was not as fast as it should have been. Also the boarding started well ahead of time which was a surprise as we had to rush towards the boarding gate as it was on final call. The flight departed on time and also arrived well ahead of time too. The crew were welcoming during the boarding and deplaning which was good however didn't get much chance to have the meals on board. Overall the flight was okay and the legroom was adequate enough for the duration of the flight. Although certain aspects like managing the check in queues could be handled better.,yes

Just few days before the flight, I get a message that my flight is cancelled due to ""issues beyond our control"". I had to book an alternate flight, which is now more than double in cost. Go First made an automated call to inform me about cancellation, but nothing to refund my money immediately. I went to their website, and there is no option for refund even though it does say that my flight is cancelled. I tried the cancel option and they have the guts to charge a cancellation fee. I tried calling them and there was a 20 min waiting period, so I chose the option of them giving me a call back. They did call back, but there was no conversation (maybe due to some mobile network glitch), but they did not make another attempt to reach me. They cancelled the flight, I lose money, I have to figure out alternate options, and I now also have to find ways to reach them to plead for my refund. How ridiculous!

Don't know why others are not getting this many operational reasons as Go First. Not travelling with Go First next time even if I have to book costlier tickets with other airlines.

But at the last a few hours before the flight, they had cancelled it without giving any reason. After putting me on the next flight, that flight is also being postponed.

I tried to do web check in on the date of travel and only paid seats are found. I checked with the Customer Service and I am told that the free seats are available only till 24 hours prior to the time of journey. Hence I am forced to pay Rs. 250/- for the middle seat (8B), though free seats are available. When I reached at Airport, the passenger in front of me and behind me also faced the same issue, but they were misguided by the Customer Service personnel that they would get free seats from the check in counter.

As per them, they tried calling me numerous times and sent multiple mails (none of them i received btw) notifying about the cancellation. Now they've told they'll give full refund for the cancellation which i dont think will happen so smoothly. These people are scamming customers with the tagline of cheapest flights.

It made me skip my breakfast in the lounge and run all the way with my wife to the boarding gate. When asked, the uncourteous reason GoFirst quoted was that they had about 85% boarding done already hence they made the final call early. Ironically the flight departed 5 mins late from Delhi. On the other hand, these folks would have definitely denied boarding if a passenger would have been late even by a minute. The bus to the aircraft was completely full putting social distancing on joke. Even after passengers complained that the bus was overcrowded, the staff was least bothered and gave a deaf ear to it. While boarding the aircraft one of the ground staffs clearly misbehaved with folks who complained about the bus situation. They made people stand unnecessarily near the aircraft and allowed boarding only after a lot of noise.",no

It was not like the flight has left, there was still 45min time but we received no help from the people there. While returning back our flight was delayed for an hour and we had to wait.

Waiting at the airport from 6 30 pm for a 10 30 am flight is alright but our flight was delayed so much that we only taxied out of Bombay at 1230 am & everyone was exhausted.

I have had heaps of bad experiences with Air India and had to forego many flights when they change schedule. When they change schedule and it does not suit you they refuse to provide you a refund and you lose the money. I preferred Indigo as I found the service good and had no problems until recently. I had booked return flights IXC-JDH in early July to fly in late August. A week ago on checking my bookings on their app I found they had changed my inbound flight from JDH to IXC from a layover in JAI to DEL. No issue with that. However there was no message or email from the airline of the change. I just happened to find out while going through my booking on the app. Not only that, the timing was changed from 1125 to 0925 hours. Had I not checked I would have missed my flight. As the new time was not suitable to me I called the airline. I was able to change to a later time. However I was told I must pay a change fee of INR 2000 per ticket. You change schedule and expect the customer to pay for it? I explained to the agent that this is an Involuntary change and I must not have to pay for it. The agent put me on hold to get an authorisation. I was able to amend the time without having to cough up the unreasonable charge. In such instances the agents should not require to get authorisation. They should be authorised to amend without wasting time on either end. Now after a week, I find out they have once again made a schedule change. They have now moved my flight from JDH to 1450 from 1025. I will arrive in DEL at 1625. However they have not amended my connecting flight DEL-IXC. That is scheduled at 1505, which will land in IXC before I even arrive in DEL. So I am back on the phone to Indigo. I requested them to put me on their DEL-IXC flt at 1725. Once again they are unable to do that. Was advised they will check and call me back. Got a call they are unwilling to put me on that flight. They want me to take a 5 hour layover in Delhi and arrive in IXC at 2230 instead of my original booked flight at 1500 hours. I once again pleaded my case. Was told they will check call me again. Again refused, obviously that is a peak hour flight and they would rather sell at a premium and let us helpless passengers waste time at the transit airport. No empathy at all. There is no recourse, either take it or leave it. I find this totally unacceptable and very poor service.",no
IndiGo,2,"""struggled due to online payment""",Manin Kulkarni,10th August 2024,"Not Verified |  Indigo treated my son in humanly at Hyderabad Airport, who was travelling first time alone as a student. Following things happened at Airport of Hyderabad.  Check in staff charged excess luggage fee which my son was willing to pay, but he struggled due to online payment. The staff removed him from the queue twice and every time made him come in queue.  They happily allowed him to throw his study books in dustbin. No courtesy was shown or effort made to talk to parents. We were online but airline staff did not task to us or help us. They made him go to empty desk and wait and then a staff came. She told, your flight luggage time is closed. You can throw luggage here and board alone. The delay was done by staff by making him queue twice and then denied boarding. He wasnt guided properly to rebook the flight. My son was struggling with bags and there was no human touch to support him. He managed to rebook the flight just to know that all previous ticket features like extra luggage and food were stripped down. They finally took him in next flight with extra luggage cost. I dont have issue paying thrice the price to airline, but really disappointed how they treated a student flying first time. Allowed him to throw books. No guidance. This was small amount which as parents we could have paid to staff or someone to help student. God knows what they will do with elderly.",no
IndiGo,1,"""quite disappointing""",Pooja Deshpande,10th August 2024,"Not Verified |  My experience from Bangkok to Bangalore, was quite disappointing. They no longer provide fragile stickers, which is concerning for passengers with fragile items in their luggage. Additionally, considering it's an international flight, the basic fare does not include any complimentary meals or drinks. Even water is not provided unless specifically requested. The in-flight services are also overpriced, with a simple dish like poha costing over 300 rupees. Furthermore, there are no pillows or blankets provided, making the presence of five or six cabin crew members seem unnecessary if they are not providing any services. If you are traveling to Thailand suggest you take Thai airways much better services comfortable and better price too.",no
IndiGo,1,"""Ground Service of IndiGo is the worst""",N Hasani,10th August 2024,✅ Trip Verified |   The Ground Service of IndiGo is the worst. The 2 ladies of Cochin ground service was beyond rude and disrespectful and charged me 1000 extra for a luggage that was below the allowed amount under student discount. Their claim was that it was in 2 baggages instead of a single one. I am a frequent flyer and this has never occurred in any of the airports before including Cochin for the same type of services. So I am guessing this was specifically because of these 2 ladies who were themselves confused on how much to charge me and wasted 20 minutes. Horrible,no

First, the codeshare with Turkish does not work properly (it is impossible to make the web check-in online and to choose seats, we have to wait until we arrive at the airport). The schedule of this flight is very unconfortable, making us impossible to have a hotel breakfast before boarding. We had 1 hour delay and not a single cabin announcement to explain it. The captain was unable to make any announcement except a brief incomprehensible announcement just before landing. The onboard entertainment was not working and we had to make the whole journey with a white screen, without any idea of the time and our position. The stewardesses distributed water generously, but instead of a meal, I received only a tiny portion of vegetable curry. I was so hungry that I had to rush into a turkish restaurant at the Istanbul airport. The stewardesses are nice, but they still wear the ridiculous ""Girl power"" badge.

IndiGo,2,“Staff is inconsiderate and inhuman”,T Sanderson,10th August 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | Indigo airlines are unreasonably inflexible. They value nonsense rules over humanity it seems. We were flying to Lucknow to visit Ayodhya. The reason we booked this flight was that it was a direct 2 hour flight and my parents are old and I did not want to get a longer itinerary with multiple flights. The flight was at 6:45AM. We reached airport at 5:30Am. I just stood in the long queue as it was the only counter that was working there. Later I found that it was for bag drop only. When asking about check-in counter they asked to check in at kiosk. When I reached there, it said check-in window is closed and that was actually very tight I ran to the only counter for all time assistance and it was queue there also. They asked me to go to supervisor Vismaya. Inspite of sharing my concern with her that our trip is a very short one and we need to reach there soon, she just did a formal call to manager who said it is not possible to check in now. My parents flight was already checked in and mine which was separate had some issues checking in one day prior when I tried. They said that your parents can board but not myself. I made humble request to consider our situation. She kept on saying we understand but we cannot help it. She booked another flight and charged extra 2500 INR per person even when the new flight was having several vacant seats. The new itinerary was long and had multiple flights. The second flight was delayed by an hour and they changed gates at the end moment and we were all tired standing up where there was no formal seating arrangement. The staff there also kept on reprimanding people to be standing in like be where there was no queue absolutely. He was just standing there and targeting people unnecessarily. There were heated arguments there also with other passengers and the staff. The airline is absolutely horrible. Staff is inconsiderate and inhuman as I found. They were behaving as if they are obliging us by having us onboarded at the flight. I will never want to travel with this flight again.",no

At first my flight got cancelled and offered me a earlier available flight to choose before a week for my travel from london to Bengaluru. So I had to choose the one available at earliest due to requirements. I traveled from London to Bengaluru and reached around 4.50am at terminal 2, at first my bags were missing and I had to sort it out and come and get my Mangalore flight of indigo scheduled to departure on 7.20am. Sorting out my missing bags issue had taken a quite of time and I had rushed to terminal 1 to board a flight. As my bags were missing I didn’t had any bags to checkin and I had directly went to security check and took 10min of time to get clear. Later I came near gate 21 and they said gates are closed just 2min ago. They refused to allow me to board 7.20 flight, I have just standing infront of them at 6.57am and they give reasons that gate closes 25min prior to departure.

I had pre-booked a meal combo on the flight, the signature Chicken Junglee sandwich, which was very good and a juice (however the beverage quantity served was very little just about 100 ml).

The lack of flexibility in this regard was not only disappointing but also inconvenient, especially considering that I had made efforts to arrive punctually. The flight was 40 minutes delayed later but still they forced us to pay for another. Adding to the frustration was the absence of announcements regarding boarding procedures.  To make matters worse, when I opted to pay for a subsequent flight, I observed a stark contrast in the boarding procedure - I witnessed passengers being allowed to board just five minutes before departure.  While I acknowledge that punctuality is essential in the airline industry, there should be a balance between adherence to schedules and customer service.",no

This service used to ensure that the passengers purchasing fast forward will get their bag first after de-boarding the plane. So I used to get fast forward because it was convenient. Having travelled today, at the check in counter, the staff tells me that there is no baggage advantage and I will get priority boarding.

At the gate I was told to go to desk for document check and asked to show visa to my final destination which is after Istanbul and has NOTHING to do with my flight with Indigo. And worst of all I lost my checked in luggage once I arrived in Istanbul. That has never happened in all my 25 years of frequent travel. All of those reviews you've seen about lost luggage & bad customer service with Indigo are completely true. Their cheap fare is not worth it.

I felt a disconnect between the airline and its passengers during this ordeal, and the updates provided were minimal, leaving me in the dark about the status of my belongings. In the end, my luggage was eventually recovered and returned to me, but the overall experience left me with a sense of dissatisfaction.",no

On 19/11/2023 flight is delayed for 2 hrs, no announcement or any information on delay. Staff at terminal gates does not have any idea on delay and are not ready to provide any proper information. They are just chilling out and avoiding customers. They are not ready to provide their superior number or call him to the gate. They are simply saying you can send an email on delay or else can go to the main counter for further information.",no

IndiGo,6,"""Overall a no-fuss experience""",S Shetty,30th November 2023,"Not Verified |  The flight was just about alright for the 2 hour hop between Delhi and Mumbai. IndiGo has introduced automated baggage drop but the instructions etc are not very clear so most end up needing assistance. Delhi's Terminal 1 is undergoing significant modification and hence the on-ground experience is not very good, with chaotic security lines and limited food options and charging stations. The in-flight experience was courteous but clinical, a typical LCC experience. The legroom was adequate and being an Airbus, the seat width is better but the slim seats are not very supportive and I would hate to be in them for anything longer than a 2 hour journey. The crew do offer free water on the flight on request and in a small glass but only after the pre-booked meals are handed over which on a hot day can be awful. Remember to carry a water bottle since in flight water bottle cost The absence of chargers, app based IFE will be felt on longer journeys. Overall a no-fuss experience but worth it only if you are saving at least 1000-1500 over full fare carriers like Vistara/Air India on the Bom-Del leg, other wise the cost of food at the airport or on-ground will mean the net savings are nil. For Frequent Fliers with status on other carriers, the bar is even higher.",no

IndiGo,2,"""boarding experience unpleasant""",G Keen,9th October 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Bought tickets with Turkish (Madrid-Mumbai) with Indigo flying Istanbul -Mumbai - Istanbul. Pretty costly ones due to the urgency to fly. Turkish has very old planes running with neanderthal entertainment systems. From Istanbul the night mare started with Indigo. - On a 7 hour flight just one very small meal and a pretty bad one (uncooked thick parathas, practically they could have given us the wheat flour instead). - No beverage options other than coca cola and water. - Neither coffee or tea was served - No entertainment system - Tried changing return flights but couldn't due to the exorbitant prices asked by Turkish to do so. So suffered the ordeal again while flying back where had fellow passengers complaining regrading the same. The boarding experience was unpleasant as they were really unorganised during the zone call. Being miser or cheap is entirely different from being a low cost Airlines. Indigo should fly cattle instead as Cattle won't complain. Do a favour on mankind by not flying international flights where you bring your corporate cheapness aboard. Rest assured I am never going to fly neither Turkish or Indigo again on an international route.",no

Finally the flight to Delhi was at 11pm! Arrival on site: no staff aware of the situation. We waited 3 hours in the middle of the night in front of the counter then we slept the remaining 2 hours in front of the boarding gate on the floor. Contract not fulfilled by the company.

The mishandling of 5 guests who were flying to Colombo due to the Trichy flight delay by 1 hour is a clear testament to the utter lack of competence and professionalism displayed by the airline.  Not only was there a complete lack of communication about the delay and the subsequent impact on connecting flights, but the airline failed to provide any assistance or support.

IndiGo,1,"""manually tagged bags were missing""",S Birvali,18th August 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Traveling with IndiGo on our recent family trip from HYD to DFW via DOH proved to be a frustrating experience that left us feeling helpless and disappointed. During our check-in at HYD, IndiGo's system was down, leading to 7 out of our 13 total checked-in bags being manually tagged. Though we understood that technical issues can happen, what followed was a series of missteps. Upon arrival at DFW, we discovered that all 7 manually tagged bags were missing. The Qatar Airways team at DFW had no information about these manually generated tags, leaving us stranded without vital belongings. We called IndiGo's customer care 9 times over three days, and each time, the response was the same: unable to reach the Hyderabad crew, and no managers on the call center floor to escalate our issue. The lack of responsiveness and the inability to locate our bags with crucial manual tags felt like a major oversight. What added to our frustration was that 5 of the 7 manual tags were taken back by the IndiGo team when their system came back online, leaving us without any physical proof. Polite customer care representatives, though unable to assist. Failure in handling manual tag situation during system downtime. While we appreciate that technical issues can occur, it's the handling of such problems that defines a company's reputation.",no

Through more than 2 hours of the journey my seat was being kicked and punched from seat 5D just behind me by a child. I complained twice and nothing happened. I asked to see the cabin supervisor and was told she was busy eating. I explained the situation to another crew member and they cautioned the Pax on seat 5D (the mother of the child) to be more decent. Finally after the third call, the family themselves moved the child to seat 4B the middle seat on the other side. At this phase of flight the captain had flashed the fasten seat belt as there was turbulence. To my shock the father of the child sat on 5C made the child stand up on the tray table of seat 4b and play with the overhead fittings including the light, the call button, the oxygen mask compartment and others. I am astonished that such risky and terrible behaviour from the parents of the child was tolerated by the crew and also that the leading lady as they are called simply refused to attend the issue. I am calling to accountability the cabin supervisor and asking Indigo to prevent the tray table from bring used as a play area. Indigo crew looks poorly trained on safety.",no

IndiGo,1,"""had the most frustrating experience""",D Rao,8th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I had the most frustrating experience with IndiGo recently, I was flying from Vadodara to Mumbai, and later in the evening connecting on an international flight to the US. While I was aware that I was allowed only one bag, when I checked in with two bags, the counter staff calculated additional charges for Rs. 12,000! Please note that this is more than the charge for a round-trip ticket between Vadodara and Mumbai! I urged the staff, including the manager on duty, to reconsider as this made no sense, I even offered to buy them a round-trip ticket just to drop my extra bag off in Mumbai and return to Vadodara! While the ground staff was very courteous, I believe the airline's pricing strategy is blatantly skewed towards fleecing international travelers. On one hand IndiGo makes history by placing the single largest order of aircrafts at the Paris Air Show (which as a person of Indian origin, I am proud of), and, literally a week later I get to experience first hand how they plan to make money by fleecing the Indian diaspora on extra baggage fees!",no

Usually in Indian aircraft that travel to and from the Middle East, the flight attendants' service is quite bad. Here, though Indigo is a budget airline, the service is similar to that of a premium airline. The only thing they can improve is that, usually in Middle Eastern flights which travel to Kerala, they give announcements in Arabic, English and Malayalam but in Indigo and other Indian aircrafts, they give the announcement in English and Hindi. I feel that in an aircraft flying to Kerala, announcements in Hindi are useless since none of us Malayalee know proper Hindi. We can just understand it from here and there.",yes

Unfortunately for some reason Indigo flight was delayed AS ALWAYS. The flight was supposed to fly 10:20 PM but it took off by 11:05 PM. Even thought the flight took off so late, the airline must cover up the time gap to reach Mumbai airport on time but in this case they didn't make an effort to do so. We reached extremely late at Mumbai International airport that the check-in counter was closed for my next connecting flight (Cathay Pacific) from Mumbai to Vancouver. Immediately we had to book another flight from Lufthansa and spend CAD 4500. This is extremely disappointing and we would not prefer to travel with Indigo Airlines ever again.",no
IndiGo,2,"""charges extra for its seat selection""",Meher Kanuri,20th February 2023,✅ Trip Verified |  Indigo charges extra for its seat selection. And now I don't understand why the flight attendant asked me to change my seat which is lower than what i paid. I left with no choice cause its for an child with 2.5yrs.

Nothing special to be highlighted in this gesture. The journey from DOH to HYD, concerns starts with Boarding until Landing. So, let's jump into facts. Boarding: All International Airlines across the globe board senior citizens, passengers on wheelchairs, and parents with kids first. For ""Indigo"" Airlines, this is not the case will ""dump"" people onto the Bus and transport them from Gate to the Aircraft. In-Flight: Seating is congested, just like Auto-Rickshaw. The cabin crew is courteous and helpful. Landing: 30 Minutes late from their scheduled arrival. As a result, we had to spend another 30 Minutes at the HYD Airport for Immigration Officers' shift rotation. Overall DOH-HYD Experience is just a dump yard ride for me in Indigo Airlines. The journey from HYD to DOH, concerns starts with Check-In until the Landing. Nonetheless, this part of the journey is the most ""Interesting"" part of this review, don't miss it. Check-In: I cannot reiterate my Boarding comment mentioned above, but this Indigo airline is adverse in implementing standards of the International Flight code. Reached the Airport 4 hours before departure, Kids in arms and eight bags to check-in (opted porter service), had to stay in line for 1 hour 25 minutes to approach the check-in counter after repeated requests to follow the check-in code. Finally, at the check-in counter, the indigo staff was inclined to charge me 15k INR extra as my three bags had 1 kg extra and other bags had less than 23 kg allowed. Perpetuating their Code-Share Policy is per bag and not Total Baggage Allowance. Another 30 minutes delayed to clean up the mess they created with bags and complete the Check-In process. Boarding: Reached the Boarding gate running upon completion of Immigration and Security clearance. Boarding will start in 30 minutes. (Boarding Feedback is the same as above). The flight missed the departure time by 27 minutes and arrived at DOH 36 minutes late. As a result, complete baggage from the Indigo flight passengers onboard couldn't board into DOH-IAD Flight. We (my family) took a personal oath not to fly ""Indigo"" in our life in their ""International"" sector to avoid amateurish personnel and never on time.

At least some of the lower service staff tried to be helpful, but the manager of the Bangalore Indigo crew  was the most unhelpful, rude, entitled person I have ever had the misfortune of meeting.

Because of them, I was not allowed because the international counter closed 5 minutes before I arrived. I kindly asked for help from the manager. But the manager only did bare minimum. My baggage is only hand carry and immigration forms has been submitted beforehand. Just needed to print boarding pass. It was a connecting flight booked through Kiwi.com.

IndiGo,1,"""management should be truly be ashamed""",M Keele,11th December 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  So, I tried to heed the many warnings that I saw in this airline's terrible reviews regarding their baggage “Scam” policy. I recently had a flight from Mumbai to Maldives, for which the ticket fare was $159 for a one-way ticket. Still a little pricey, but not bad. The only reason why I took this airline was because it was the only airline available that had a direct flight to the Maldives. After booking the ticket, I noticed right away that it said only 20 kilo bag allowance. My initial thought was that it was a low weight for an international flight, but I'm sure I can purchase a bag, just in case. The week of the flight, I spent quite a bit of time looking through the baggage options. One problem is that the website will not allow you to add a bag until 48 hours before the flight, which is incredibly inconvenient when you are traveling. At 48 hours, I started the attempt to add a bag. The website is not user-friendly when it comes to adding bags. When you click on the add bags button, it takes you to another screen which then has two more buttons for add to cart or purchase now. Neither of these buttons work. I tried on Safari, Chrome, and also my mobile. Nada. The day before the flight, I spent well over an hour trying to figure out how to do it. On my mobile, I was able to get a little closer to where it would add excess weight, but only 5 kilos. You click on that button and the screen goes blank. Long story short, I had to spend an enormous amount of time on my holiday trying to add a dang bag. I finally found the loophole. When you go to 6e add-ons (where the add baggage should be but isn't) and just click on anything that is listed. It will take you to the add-on page and then there it is. Add a bag. More confusion sets in, because it says add an additional bag for 1800 rupees (~$22 usd). I thought, perfect! One catch, I didn't see anywhere that says what the additional weight is of that bag like you do on ALL the other airline websites out there. The morning of the flight, I saw my bags were still a little too heavy, so I added an extra 5 kilos, which was $40 for just 5 kilos. Yes, $40 for just 5 kilos. I get to the airport and my two bags were 35 kilos. Guy said that my bags were too heavy. I was so confused. I tried what I could to avoid a nightmare and yet it happened anyway. Come to find out, you are allowed 2 bags of 20 kilos TOTAL. Doesn't say total on the website. So, you have to pay $22 extra for the same exact weight, but for an additional bag! What the ever living. That makes no sense. You pay extra for a bag, but actually get less weight, because the additional bag will also add weight, so you have to pack less items. What a disaster. I ended up having to pay $162 in baggage fees for my $159 flight. How the government allows this, I have no clue. I saw a review where someone mentioned highway robbery. Good description, but more like extortion. I also notice that it tends to happen more to foreigners traveling. You have been warned, DO NOT use this airline. Hopefully one day, a reputable airline like Vistara (which was great) will buy this company out and change things around for the good, because the current management should be truly be ashamed. And if anyone asks about the plane size and baggage weight, it was a normal size plane, probably more to the larger size. There is only one reason for these kinds of prices and it is GREED.

When I called them to ask for a tin of cookies for my son, the 1st time I was told they need to serve pre booked meals 1st and then only they will get back to me, and the 2nd time again I asked while collecting trash and they said give us 5 minutes. So basically only pre booked meals passengers were given priority while those even though willing to buy in the air were not even asked if they wanted water. The crew just moved past my row and I had to call her back to ask for the cookies. If this is the kind of service offered, it's better IndiGo clearly states that only pre booked meals will be given any priority.

The boarding pass did not show the gate and the tv screens in the airport didnt show the gate until 5:00 am. We got to the gate at 5:15 and they said go to another counter quickly, from there they said quickly follow Indigo employee assuming he is trying to get us on the flight, instead he stamps the tickets and walk us out to the ticket counter. We waited an hour with 50-60 other people who missed their flight. When we got to the counter they said the next flight is not until tomorrow and its and additional 5000 rs for the tickets.

IndiGo,1,"""careless with sensitive luggage""",S Wayamandi,19th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Indigo was utterly careless in handing a sensitive item like infant / baby child restraint system (CRS) and caused damage even after we safely handed it to them at the gate.  The bag is badly torn and the car seat inside scratched when we received it at the destination. The bag which holds the car seat was expensive too and was not a flimsy one which would have gotten easily torn unless it was handled badly. We use the bag for the car seat exclusively for checking the car seat while flying and have been in 6 flights so far without any issues.  It is clear that the seat and bag were subjected to a lot of stress and abrasion and we will forever be doubting the structural integrity of the car seat which is worth over 75k INR due to Indigo's shoddy handling. We made Indigo aware of this issue after we got down and collected the item at VTZ. Without trying to understand the extent of the damage, Indigo's agent blindly offered 500 rupees. We did not accept since just the bag alone costs 10 times that amount. She also tried to push blame on us that the bag was not strong enough to handle air travel. It is appalling that Indigo thinks this is normal handling for a car seat in their business. We left the airport since we disagreed with her 500 rupees offer and did not know what else to do. Agent used our lack of knowledge and did not mention that the correct process is for us file a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) with her and use the PIR to later submit a claim to Indigo later. We later found out that leaving the airport without PIR means that we accepted everything was in good condition and cannot hold Indigo liable anymore.

I did so, but my web check-in failed with with message saying that I was I the ""watch queue"". I contacted the help desk, which was not very quick, but in the meanwhile I browsed the internet and found out that, since I booked my flight with an international credit card I needed to show the credit card at the check-in. Luckily enough, I brought the credit card with me (it was about to expire, and I have more than one credit card, so I really thought I could leave it at home) otherwise they would have denied boarding.

My trip from New Delhi T-1 to Surat on 6-july 2022 was perfect. Only I wish the Airhostess wish passengers with big smile and welcome message when we embark. Most of the time its a miss. It goes a long way in the feel good factor of passengers.,yes
IndiGo,8,"""the crew were able to discharge their duties well""",V Reddy,16th July 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | I had to book this flight very suddenly due to an urgent issue and also due to the ongoing ATF prices for the airlines the prices were on the higher side. The online check in was a smooth process and as this was booked with a corporate fare, the seat selection was free. The baggage drop at the counter was a smooth and quick affair. Boarding started on time and the crew were able to discharge their duties well. For the corporate meal, I was pleased to note that the selection had increased from the last time and also included items like chicken noodles and biriyani along with tea, coffee, juices. The portions of the food were okay. The flight landed on time and the crew did not manage to wish goodbye and thank others but did wish me when I passed by which was appreciated. One thing to note was that the inflight magazine and the air sickness bag were not there on every seat and perhaps this is something that can be included on all seats as a feedback item. But otherwise, this was a good flight.",yes

Airport staff was surprised by the fact that how can they close their counter this early they tried their best to contact the airline to help me but no one picked up the phone.  I lost my flight and had to book another flight which cost me extra $500 also made me lose my friends wedding which was sole reason i booked this trip.

Myself along with my old parents and a 5 year old was informed at the counter about online check in process or else were supposed to pay 200rs each to get a boarding pass at the counter  I finally ended calling my brother who did that for us.

Cost of middle seat is minimum Rs 90/ and cost of aisle or window seat is minimal Rs 150 or max Rs 350.

Did'nt expect the experience will be so bad. This flight 6E 1407 on the 23rd April 2022 was supposed to fly from Lucknow India at 21:30 as per schedule. We were asked to board the flight. And then the wait started, at first they said some technical error we should be go to fly soon. But then it was delayed by almost four hours. People where seated in the aircraft with no air condition / no water to drink. The air hostess were helpless. The main reason for the delay was because the pilot who was supposed to fly this aircraft didn't turn up for some reason. So the airline decided to make us wait in the aircraft under these conditions ... is this acceptable? Indigo has been a good experience for me early. This was one experience that I faced recently.",no

International travellers are not allowed to carry more then 15kg of luggage whereas the international allows 40 kg it means international travellers be away. International connecting is allowed to carry 30kg on payment of RS. 6600. Even after paying RS 6600/- the passenger must pay extra RS 2000 if made 2 bags instead of 1 bag of 30kg.

IndiGo,8,"""recent experience was a fantabulous one""",Arjun Kumar,15th May 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  While Indigo does boast about its on time departure and pre time arrival, I don't think that is what makes it the best airline. I have never liked the attitude of many Air Hostesses on this airline, as I have always found them on the edge of being rude. However, my recent experience was a fantabulous one and I need to appreciate two women, who made this journey a happy one. Joyce - Based at the Indigo counters in Hyderabad, automatically upgraded my seat from 4C to 1C, seeing that I am a tall man and would have issues in the back seats. Janett - Air hostess on the flight 6E - 796, departure time 1950, dated 30.3.22. She was extremely hospitable and showed all signs of a great hospitality professional.

I had to ask for water (forget anything else), forget choosing free seats. The lights were very dim, making reading impossible. Last time in November 2021 I flew with Indigo from Mumbai to Kolkata. I booked about 20 days or so in advance. Thrice my flight was rescheduled and I had to change my entire programme. I paid extra for a window seat.",no

So I reached the airport 2.5 hr prior to get seats together. I waited 15 min in queue then requested same to counter. She sent me to a different counter then again waited for 15min in a queue, then finally she said, we couldn't do it, so we were given 28A which having a baby seat also, you keep your baby in the baby seat and request co passenger for interchange. We couldn't find baby seat there, same thing asked to airhostess, she replied, there is no baby seat. They didn't even gave the baby belt, which is mandatory. Airline not for babies.",no
IndiGo,4,"""don't expect any support""",Stephanie Preyer,27th February 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I originally intended to give IndiGo a good revues, as I've been travelling India for 2 months and their service was fine for the most part. However, in the last week the airline has had 2 major mishaps which have completely unravelled my travels and I felt compelled to warn other travellers. Firstly, they didn't inform travellers that Nepal requires an exit PCR test in order to leave the country. Of course, you could argue that it's up to the traveller to check requirements but all the all focus is always on entry requirements for the destination country. I've travelled throughout covid and Nepal was the first country I went to requiring an exit test. Any other airline would have sent an email letting their customers know, but not IndiGo. As a result, there was chaos at the airport and I missed my flight, along with 10 others. I flew the next day Kathmandu to Chennai (after paying 10000 rupees fare difference) with a short layover in Delhi. I was assured by IndiGo staff at check in that my bag would go straight through to Chennai, and they put Chennai as the final destination on the baggage ticket, so there was no reason for me to go to baggage collection in Delhi. Upon arrival in Chennai at 1am after a delayed departure, I was told my bag hadn't arrived because I was supposed to have cleared customs at Delhi Airport. It's now been 3 days, my bag is still in Delhi and IndiGo have no idea what's going on. They don't even know the right number to call at Delhi Airport to get an update. At the end of the day, fly IndiGo if you want a cheap flight and can count on things going according to plan, but don't expect any support if there are any disruptions as they don't appear to have the customer's best interests at heart.",no
IndiGo,4,"""This is unorganised!""",A Harper,27th February 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | Only 15 kilograms check in luggage! Charge extra for everything, demanding 200 rupees for not checking online although the link didn't work. Demanded extra for an extra couple of kilos. Not assigning empty seats for customers, rather than cramping them together and leave empty seats at the back empty, just because they didn't pay for these seats! This is unorganised! No food on the plane, Air India was exactly the opposite of this, nice seat, 25 kilos of luggage, which is more than enough, ultra smooth check-in and offered a sandwich and a drink on just 1 hour flight.",no
IndiGo,9,"""Overall an uneventful flight""",A Vashun,27th February 2022,Not Verified | I took the flight to Kolkata on IndiGo. The web check in was done smoothly and it must be noted that the seats at the rear are cheaper as compared to those in the front which is strange as they are the same seats.  The baggage drop was done quickly and efficiently at BLR airport. And boarding started well on time. The crew were welcoming during boarding which was good and the arrival and baggage collection was also Swift. Overall an uneventful flight which took me from point A to B without too much fuss.,yes
IndiGo,1,"""Really cheap strategy""",Vipin Babu,27th February 2022,"Not Verified |  I booked a ticket on Indigo on 03 Jan 22 for 05 Jan 22 Cochin to Dubai at departure time 00.30 local time but after the booking I get an SMS stating the departure time on 05 Jan 22 is 13.00 local time which is a delay of almost 13 hours and do not serve my purpose for the day. Their website had a problem then why should I suffer for it, hence I requested a full refund for which they are not willing to give. I called them and after talking to their customer service for 01 hour or more, she would not give a full refund, neither solve the issue nor let me speak to her manager and wanted me to book for another date. From her I understood that the 04 Jan 22 flight was cancelled and they rescheduled the 05 Jan 22 flight, which I did not want due to the change in timing and fly with another airline as I have to reach on 05 Jan 22 early morning. These guys go by On Time departure and Arrival but none of that is true. So all of you be beware and customer service has a few lines which they repeat for every question and it really annoys you as this is not the right reply in English for a question asked. Pathetic situation to cheat you out of your money as when you cancel they get a free amount of INR 5,500/-. Disgrace to this company and the people who work for it and own it. Really cheap strategy.",no
IndiGo,5,"""it's a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage""",V Reddy,27th February 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | On the return flight from Indore, the check-in of the luggage was done very swiftly as we reached the airport well ahead of departure. The boarding also started well on time. One thing that was observed was the huge amount of cabin baggage and the size of that baggage was also very big and yet there were no checks related to the hand baggage performed by the airline staff because it seemed that a lot of luggage were exceeding the 7kg limit and also the dimensions. Perhaps time for the airline to start checking hand luggage? The crew instructed the passengers to keep their backpacks under the seats but during take-off it was observed that a lot of passengers were keeping the backpacks on their lap which was a gross safety violation and yet the crew did not enforce the safety policy properly. Being efficient and on time is important, but never at the cost of safety. The flight itself was uneventful with a upma / tea snack provided as part of the corporate fare and reached on time. I appreciate flying with the airline, but customer satisfaction should never come at the expense of safety norms as this would impact any evacuation procedures. Perhaps this is something that should be kept in mind. And also it's a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage taken on board the aircraft as well to avoid such incidents in the future. The rating is given based on the safety violation of not stowing away the cabin bags under the seat during takeoff but apart from that the flight and crew were really good.",yes
IndiGo,9,"""could not have asked for anything better""",S Vanush,27th February 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had to go Indore for a family function and on this particular flight, we had checked in online and as the fare booked was a corporate fare the seat selection was free. At Bangalore airport, there is a separate section where the passengers can just drop off their bags and the staff there ensure that the bags are checked in which seems to be a much faster process and this is something that other airlines can emulate in order to reduce the waiting time in queues. Also another point to note is that even though the kiosk machines were not working and were unable to print the boarding passes, one can use the mobile boarding pass on the mobile phones for security access. This is also something I experienced first hand and was very valuable. The boarding started on schedule and the flight itself was very comfortable and as the booking was a corporate booking, one is entitled to a single meal and a beverage. I selected the paneer masala rice as it was in the afternoon time. The food was pretty decent along with the tea. Staff service was prompt and polite. Arrival was 30 mins ahead of schedule which was appreciated and the crew was wearing a smile on their faces even while de-boarding and thanking the passengers. Overall could not have asked for anything better.",yes
IndiGo,2,"""we are very disappointed with the airline""",Akhil Pavi,27th February 2022,"Not Verified |  To start with, we were travelling to Male, Maldives from Cochin using Indigo, we had booked our flight from Cochin to the Maldives and then onwards to Bahrain. The check in counter staff member reacted very differently to us trying to travel telling us we are supposed to book a return flight back to India from the Maldives as per ‘air bubble agreement’, since we didn’t have time to review the reasons mentioned by the airline, we had no choice but to book a return flight to India. This was not enough for the airline, they wanted a direct flight back. We again made our travel agent rebook, while we didn't cancel our flight to Bahrain, since we didn't trust the totally misinformed Indigo staff, we travelled, spent days in the Maldives and travelled to Bahrain without any hassles! We checked and rechecked with Male airport as well, no such rule was there! Wrong information besides being totally un cooperative towards customers, we are very disappointed with the airline, especially as I have never experienced this. We had asked to meet with the manager, instead of asking him to come to talk to us, we were sent to some counter where he was seated fidgeting with his phone, laid back and totally uncooperative. I am not a person who likes writing such reviews but such incidents are very very problematic. Hope Indigo take appropriate action.",no
IndiGo,2,"""flight had no meal supplies""",Sumit Arora,27th February 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  This flight had no meal supplies and I had a meal booked with my ticket.  I was offered cashews & almonds in place of a meal at 8 PM. The Air Hostess told me ""There are more options available but today we don't have any."" This happened when I was sitting in 6th row, I can only imagine what people in 16th or 60th row had.  Why would you charge money for a meal & not provide it?",no

The lady at the checkin desk was really helpful, she first refused but later checked with Chirag and than it was run run run - he guided me to the boarding gate. Made my London flight on time Can’t thank him the the check in desk staff enough. Saved me from panic attack. In the last 10 days I have travelled at least 5 times with the Indigo.

The staff said, I am late, they were not allowing me to board. But with the support of two employees of Indigo Airlines Ruksar and Satendra are really nice people. They understand the situation. The two have been very helpful to me. She insisted on it and gave me my boarding pass. Thanks, Indigo must be proud both of you two.",yes
IndiGo,1,"""substandard quality of service""",Irfan Ismail,10th September 2021,"Not Verified |  Rude staff, substandard quality of service and they will loot your money over excess baggage weight and other surprise fees not warned to the customer beforehand on their website. Their website for example provides the fee for pre booked additional baggage weight but does not mention the fee if excess baggage is found during boarding.",no
IndiGo,10,"""the seat selection was free""",V Sharun,10th September 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  When doing the online web check in, I was pleased to note that since I had booked using a corporate fare, the seat selection was free and also I was entitled to 1 complementary snack onboard the flight. The baggage drop process was smooth although due to huge queues at Bangalore airport, the IndiGo staff quickly collected all the bags from the pax in a separate queue which allowed quick deposit of the bags. Boarding started on time and I learnt that for the complementary snack, there was a choice of upma / poha for veg items and chicken noodles for the non veg items along with the choice of a beverage (hot / cold). The sandwiches could not be availed as part of a CPML booking as I found out but the quantity of the items was on a generous side which was appreciated. The flight landed also on time at Kolkata, however the baggage took some time before coming. In the end, I got more for what I paid for including free seat selection and a complementary meal, and got safely to my destination on time. Cannot ask for anything more.",yes
IndiGo,10,"""one of the top LCCs in Asia""",H Sharvun,10th September 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  At Mumbai airport, during check in, the staff took care to verify the negative RT PCR reports of all the passengers travelling to Karnataka which was appreciated even though the seat selection during online check in was not free unlike the previous time when I flew which was a surprise. Boarding started well ahead of schedule and it seems that Indigo is deploying with high capacity Airbus A321 Neo aircraft on high density routes to get as much passengers and load as possible. The crew was welcoming and wished everyone during boarding and deboarding which was much appreciated as these small things do matter. The luggage could have perhaps come a bit earlier than expected but apart from that there is nothing much that one can fault IndiGo on because everything was perfect: the fare, the on time arrival, the crews attitude. It has rightly achieved it's status as one of the top LCCs in Asia.",yes
IndiGo,2,"""counters had been closed at 7:30""",Aamli Agarwal,10th September 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a morning flight of 8:30 am from Ahmedabad to Lucknow. I reached the airport at 7:25 am and was standing in the IndiGo line for check-in. Around 7:32 am, the IndiGo lady asked where I was going and other few passengers as well. When we informed her that it was Lucknow, the lady removed us from the line informing us that the counters had been closed at 7:30. She was very stubborn and was not ready to listen or even guide us on what to do next. The next 20 min just flew by running from indigo counter to counter. The lady on the reservation counter didn't even inform me of the fact that if a customer missed their flight and books it via their counter the fee charged is Rps 1800 and the PNR given is the same. A customer doesn't need to restart their booking again. Luckily my husband guided me on this procedure to which the lady confirmed.",no
IndiGo,10,"""the seat selection was free""",V Sharun,10th September 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was pleased to note that during the online check in for this flight, the seat selection was free because in previous experiences of flying with IndiGo, they usually charge a fee of around Rs 150 for selecting a seat. The baggage drop was a smooth process and departure was on time. The crew took steps to check for negative RT-PCR reports or proof of fully vaccinated during the time of boarding which was appreciated. Arrival was on time and IndiGo did the job of transporting from point A to B in a fairly reasonable price for a 1 hour 40 minute flight.",yes
IndiGo,10,"""Thank you IndiGo""",Ashish Khokar,10th September 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Yesterday (11 july) I brought my 90 year old mother back and from entry to exit, each member of IndiGo staff provided exemplary care. From wheelchair to security to plane they took genuine care. The surprise started by Sujata politely asking if we would like front row seats, which I had wanted but while booking couldn't get. That gave us comfort in 2 hours flight and Sujata accompanied us through security, which often can be cumbersome. Other staff too helped selflessly. Cabin crew was kind. Covid protocols are followed to a T by IndiGo. In Bengaluru on arrival Keertana helped and escorted all through till exit. It made travel with a near blind, wheelchair bound mother very doable. Thank you IndiGo. Way to go!",yes
IndiGo,1,"""obscene cancellation/change fees""",T Patusa,10th September 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have not flown on this flight yet. It's a future reservation that I have with them, and need to cancel because my onward/return journey between Mumbai and Seychelles that was part of the overall travel itinerary was cancelled due to Covid restrictions in Seychelles for passengers from India. So I need to cancel these IndiGo flights, as I have no need to travel to Mumbai and back now. When I call the customer service line to cancel, I get the following: They mention flight fees and changes on their website but fail to mention that they charge these per passenger per flight/sector when you need make changes or cancellations to your reservation. For a $180 round trip flight booked for my wife and I from Tirupati to Mumbai and back, they were saying I will get a refund of $28 even though I'm canceling almost 2 months in advance. Based on their USD cancellation fee of $45 that should be charged for cancellations made 4+ days before departure, I should receive a $135 refund. Or if they were strictly following this fee applied per person per flight, then that would be $45 per person per way, i.e. $45x4=$180 so I should not receive any refund. But they make an arbitrary calculation that I get $28 refund. They pretend to be a low-cost carrier that's friendly to the middle class in India, but actually charge obscene cancellation/change fees.",no
IndiGo,1,"""They should inform earlier""",Khyati Sethia,10th September 2021,Not Verified |  Cancelled Flight and informed just one day before. My RT-PCR report and money got wasted. I was also able to do web-check in but they cancelled the flight after that. They should inform earlier.,no
IndiGo,8,"""provided with a covid-19 safety kit""",S Venkatesh,10th September 2021,"Not Verified |  Recently I flew on Indigo on Economy class from Coimbatore International airport in India to India's capital city's New Delhi Indira Gandhi INTL airport.  This is my second flight after the pandemic lock down, things have changed a lot after the pandemic. The online check-in and selection of seats which is chargeable has been made mandatory, my flight was a bit behind the schedule departure time. As a low cost airline there is no In-flight Entertainment and food have to be pre-booked online and you also have the option to buy onboard with limited selection. All the passengers seated in the aisle and window seats were provided with a covid-19 safety kit that had a face shield, a face mask and some sanitizers, the passenger who were about to be seated in the middle seats were provided with PPE kits. As I had pre-booked the in-flight meal, I had to select from the list of available options and I had opted for a prepacked bottle of fruit juice and a bowl of prepacked readily made south Indian food. The food was above average even though it was a prepacked one.",yes

I had Pre-booked my inflight meals and the snack box was sealed. The cabin crew wore their safety gown and masks all the time and ensures all the pax wore masks throughout the flight.

IndiGo,10,"""I had a great experience flying IndiGo""",D Reddy,17th March 2021,"✅ Trip Verified | As always I had a great experience flying IndiGo. It was a quick one day trip from Lucknow to Goa and also my first in over a year since the pandemic. I was very impressed with the ground and cabin staff ensuring all the passengers maintained social distancing while boarding and in the cabin during flight. Before boarding all passengers were given a Safety Kit packet which included a face shield,face mask and 5-6 pouches of hand Sanitizers, also the best thing was that all the middle seat passengers were also made to wear the safety gown along with the face mask and face shield which is a good safety measure. The inflight magazine wasn't available but understandable as they are trying to minimize the contact as much as possible. Water bottles were free of cost even though pre-covid IndiGo used to serve water in cups but it's nice they are serving water bottles free of cost and also in addition to that they are served free tea and coffee as well. Snacks and hot food items were available for sale, however, I had pre booked my Food item while making the booking and it was served in IndiGo branded pack and sealed and tasted as good as it looked. The flight did depart 5 minutes behind schedule but I won't mind 5 minutes given IndiGo sanitizers their aircrafts before and after every flight so I'd rather depart late than departing unsure of the safety.

Interior of the flight requires some enhanced cleaning. They enforced the ones occupying middle seat to wear PPE. Cabin crew were nice, helpful, paid attention to all the unwanted needs of unruly passengers. I liked the bamboo cutleries, which is environmentally friendly rather than the plastic ones. Flight reached Delhi before the time and luggage came out on time. Everything was great except one major problem I had. I pre-booked my meal, which was a paneer salad. Salad was served with a bread roll. When I opened the bag, I found the bread had mould.  I showed it to a cabin crew, and she was apologetic and offered any food, drinks I want. I declined her offer and returned the paneer salad.",yes
IndiGo,9,"""boarding started ahead of time""",S Harshun,17th March 2021,✅ Trip Verified |  We decided to go for a quick vacation within the state as we did not want to take any chances travelling outside any state and chose to go to Mangalore which was a 50 minute short journey. Check in was smooth and the bag drop was done quickly aswell. The flight boarding started ahead of time and the flight load was on the higher side. Departure and arrival were well ahead of schedule and Indigo did the job of transporting from point A to point B. The pilots updated the passengers on the flight details which was appreciated but it seems the crew were rushed with their announcements.,yes

But despite having all proper documentation (PCR covid, health, etc) we were stopped in Kolkata by Indigo Airlines. They gave us a hellish experience - finding faults and even accusing us of not knowing protocols. I am a frequent international traveller. She didn't even know where our arrival ticket was as it was lying in front of her. She didn't give us any option(s) nor reassurance or help. She was intent on ruining our vacation.

IndiGo,9,"""IndiGo does the job very well""",H Vashun,17th March 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our initial flight which was supposed to be a direct flight from Mumbai to Kolkata was cancelled and so as an alternative the airline offered various alternatives, one of which was via HYD which we took. The airline claimed that the flight was cancelled due to Covid restrictions but is clear that the flight was cancelled due to lack of good loads and so instead of the usual travel time of 2.5 hours the total flight duration was almost 6 hours which could have been better. At least during the online check-in the airline didn't charge us for paying extra for the seat selection which was a slight relief. Both the flight segments themselves were quite okay and departed well on time even though some of the conduct of the passengers was questionable like not wearing the face shield / hazmat suit for the middle row seats even despite the crew reminding the passengers to wear it numerous times. Nowadays when flying low cost carriers, it seems like a bus journey with wings where the airlines try to get as many passengers stuffed inside the aircraft as much as possible. If you are a passenger who likes to travel in a bit of exclusivity and luxury without feeling claustrophobic about the number of people surrounding you, you are better off travelling on other airlines. But if however, you prefer getting from point A to point B with slightly cheaper fares, then IndiGo does the job very well.",yes

I shouldn’t have worried this was an excellent airline for a low cost carrier. Everything was exceptional from check in to boarding. The crew were so immaculately groomed and the cabin service was excellent. Nothing was too much trouble. They worked hard to ensure that the cabin was as tidy as possible to enable a quick turn round for the return flight.

Due to the corona virus outbreak there was hardly any passengers travelling on this flight. So check in was a breeze. The check in agents were quite helpful and they had a bottle of hand sanitizers on their desks which was well appreciated. The boarding commenced well before the scheduled time of departure and it was clear that travel was at a minimum as the flight was quite empty The crew were polite enough and even though I slept for most part of the flight, the departure and arrival was well before time. Baggage retrieval was a breeze as there were hardly any passengers and this was a very uneventful flight.

At the end of the flight we had to seat on the landed plane for about 15-20 minutes with no explanation given and then while exiting we were given some form to fill in on the spot (but no pens to fill it in with). One plus was that the staff at Delhi airport were quite nice and the ones on the plane were fine as well.",no

I entered my card details about 7 times and it came back with an error, not even knowing if the payment went through. The rest of the time I have tried it didn't even get to the payment stage or it simply didn't even show the flights at all. In these 24 hours, the price of the tickets increased by 25%. I tried to online chat with an agent, however, they had no solution for me and kept telling me to try again. After a while of back and forth, the agent offered to hold the tickets for me and I can log in after and pay for them.

If your health/mind/luggage is important to you I do not suggest to ever travel with them. They lost my luggage, they did not refund the money for the cancelled flight and they were lying to me that they found my luggage just to mislead me and make me go away. I hate this airline. They hurt me emotionally and physically, 3 days spent at the airport just looking for a bag. I booked another flight and they told me my bag will be loaded. When I was boarding they said my bag isn’t there and no one knows where is it. They are the worst in the world. And if you’re thinking “ah they’re cheaper then others that’s ok” - it's wrong. That’s what I was thinking and trust me it’s not worst the experience I had with them. Don’t fly with IndiGo.",no

IndiGo,7,"""content with their services""",S Vanesh,5th March 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Bengaluru by Indigo. Check-in for the flight was smoothly done via the kiosks as well as the baggage security screening. The staff at the counter had informed in advance that the flight was going to be delayed due to the late arrival of the incoming flight which was good however on the notification screens it was still displayed that the flight was on time and this was only updated when the boarding was around the corner. The flight was delayed by an hour. So that meant instead of reaching the destination at 2310 hours, the arrival was at 2350 hours which was kind of late. At the boarding gate, there was an irate passenger who was taking his frustration out on the staff but the staff handled the situation extremely well. The boarding process was hurried as the crew tried to compensate for the delay which was much appreciated. The rest of the flight was pretty uneventful. However during de-boarding, the crew were polite and wished goodbye to me but not to everyone probably due to the fact that the crew were not expecting the rest of the passengers to thank them. Baggage was also retrieved in a safe condition. As a paying customer, I am content with their services and even though things like delays can happen in a congested area like India, they get the job done.",yes
IndiGo,9,"""by and large a flawless flight""",N Sharvin,5th March 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bengaluru to Kolkata. On this early morning flight, I had arrived at the airport much ahead of schedule and despite that, I still managed to check in and print the boarding pass selecting my seat which saves on the money if one were to check online. Baggage drop was easily done and the agent at the desk was with a pleasant demeanor. Boarding started ahead if schedule on this flight and was warmly greeted by the flight attendants. As it was during the Christmas time, the background music was related to the holidays which was a nice touch. Departure was on time and the rest of the flight passed off uneventfully. Arrival was on time and was able to collect my baggage as well. Only thing I observed was that the key chain of my bag was missing even though the contents of the bag appear to be intact. And I am not sure if the airline or any of the baggage handlers might be responsible for the loss of the keychain. But it could quite easily have resulted in the loss of any other items so I am not sure. This aspect has the only negative over what was by and large a flawless flight.",yes

I have flown Indigo from Nagpur to Pune for the fifth time this month and yet again this flight was delayed as it always does. This time the delay is more than 5 hours and I am writing this review while waiting for the delayed flight. This particular route's flight always gets delayed and by now Indigo should have taken note and tried to fix the root cause of the issue. How can the same route flight get delayed always? Every single time I have flown from Nagpur to Pune with Indigo, there have been delays. On top of that, there is no refund or alternatives offered for the inconvenience caused due to delays. I could have definitely preferred some other airlines if there were options available for night departures. Unfortunately only Indigo fits into my schedule and I have to choose it for business purpose. I hope Indigo takes note and corrects this issue.",no

I did as I was told - wrote three emails and I received exactly the same computer-generated reply from 2 different customer service officers.

Varanasi to Amritsar via Delhi with IndiGo. Four domestic flights in India, ranging in length from one to three hours. The planes are clean and fly on time. The cabin crew are kept very busy, so don't have a lot of time to be friendly to passengers. In most cases boarding and disembarking is via a bus, but it's pretty well organised. (There was only one chaotic boarding experience, when the airline was trying to make up lost time due to a late arriving inbound flight.) The seats offer reasonable legroom. We prepaid the Prime package - with extra baggage, seat selection and a snack and drink - and found that this worked very well on all four flights.

The airline IndiGo is no different. Keeping in mind that this is a low-cost carrier, it was virtually impossible to tack any negativity onto this airline. They embrace a fun outlook on just about everything, from their inflight magazine, titled ‘6E’ (pronounced ‘sexy’), to their luggage buggies on the tarmac, called ‘Ground Force’. Yes, the seats are narrow (no worse than any other budget airline) and they don’t recline, which is a blessing when you’re trying to watch a video on your tablet/phone – that’s right, the seats do not have monitors built-in. You pay for food and beverages (it’s the norm now), but the prices are fair and some of the snacks are served in fun packaging that you might even want to take home. I know I did.

After we got off from the flight, passenger with an onward journey to KTM were asked to just wait at the arrival gate exit without any explanation of why we have to wait and for how long we have to wait. We were held for about 20 minutes without enough seat there. At KTM airport, check-in was fairly nonchalant, again no smiles.

I was walking through the airport randomly looking for your staff to sort this issue out and found one of your agents. She looked through it and tried from her end and told me it won’t be possible at this time as other seats are already occupied and you can do it on board and there is a lady seated at 19D. I told her my daughter is already tired from the Male flight and it’s important for us to sit together. She understood our situation and told she will try her best. At time of boarding I explained the same situation to boarding agent. She replied the same saying you should try it on board as nothing she could do it now. There comes the pleasant surprise! This staff member came all the way to our gate which she doesn’t have to bother doing at all. She literally looked for the passenger seated at 19D and talked to her and agreed to swap seats with mine. I was very much overwhelmed with her genuine concern towards our issue and how she went well and above to sort this out for us. Please pass my sincere gratitude to her. She deserves it. However on other hand on board it was totally opposite experience. I know it’s a short flight to CNN but crew didn’t make any effort to do the service for this flight. They didn’t took the food cart out to the aisle or neither brought the round of water at least. They were just busy in the galley throughout until landing. I never even saw them securing the cabin!

IndiGo,2,"""staff is very poor""",Arshad Noor Siddiquee,17th September 2019,✅ Trip Verified | Delhi to Nagpur. All my experiences with this airline are very poor. Specially the courtesy of the staff is very poor. The legspace and the seats are very uncomfortable. One must choose to fly with this airline only when there is no alternative. The staff right at the check-in to even the customer care is so rude. The boast to fly on time but at what cost. They maintain the schedule at the cost of inconvenience of the guest. Onboard food is horrible. Overall one should prefer any other available alternative.,yes

I was coming from the USA to Hyderabad with an intermediate connection through IndiGo in Delhi. My check-in luggage was close to 45 kgs (with an excess of 30 kgs). However, under normal baggage policy terms, the excess amount was coming out to be 30x400 = 12000 INR. Because of two ground staff intervention, they helped me realize the facility of International customers and their luggage benefits. Went the extra mile to confirm the price with the technical service team and made me pay 7800 INR, instead of 12K. I really appreciate these two staff members’ professionalism in taking 40 min extra time to help me and support me through out the check in process. Thanks to these two staff members for your “Customer Centric” service in the middle of the night for a jet-lagged customer like me. Well done IndiGo for maintaining such enthusiastic employees.",yes

Bought a sandwich on both legs, which was amazing. When I compare the services of Indigo to the low-cost airlines in the US, all I can say there is no comparison. Indigo has a far superior product.",yes

This is the only airline I have flown that has such a hard restriction on carry-on weight: 7kg per person, period. This makes it impossible to carry a laptop bag and a carry-on with clothes. Even other low-cost airlines (eg. Jetstar) will allow you to pay for extra carry-on weight. As a business traveler flying 5 times in 8 days, this is a colossal waste of time waiting for checked bags at every stop. Not to mention the risk of an eventual misplaced bag.",no

One of the passenger is a 5yr old. I just have one question, are you guys that stupid to not understand that a child would need the company of one of the parents? When I asked the staff for assistance all they had to say is to try to convince any of the passengers to move. Great help. To me, this is a disastrous experience.",no

I got the biggest shock of IndiGo's on-time performance. Once the incoming flight landed, they immediately started boarding and even after scanning our boarding pass they made us wait three times at three places, as there were still passengers deplaning from the incoming flight! I was flying with two elderly passengers with knee problems as this took a big toll on their leg having to wait for a long while. This also means they did not even clean the plane at all as soon as the incoming flight landed. How unhygienic! This is how they fly on-time. High On-time performance at the cost of hygiene!",no

IndiGo,1,"""one of the luggage was lost""",Arathi Pv,21st July 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Kochi. On May 31, I reached the airport at around 6:00 AM and checked in at the emergency counter. I had a friend also traveling with me whose luggage was less than 15 Kg. I asked the indigo staff if my excess luggage can be adjusted with him. Staff  told me to pay the extra amount. I immediately agreed to pay. Hence as per the baggage policy, I paid 400*10Kg -4000Rs. On arriving at Kochi airport after a 40-minute wait, I discovered that one of the luggage was lost and reported to the baggage claim representative. After waiting for more than 30 minutes, she cross-checked with the boarding pass and confirmed me that the bag of 10Kg is missing. I spoke to the indigo staff and have no information for me as to the whereabouts of my luggage. One of the senior officials of Indigo called me on June 9th and confirmed that the bag weight was 10Kg and a refund of 3500INR will be given. I expressed a complete dissatisfaction as I paid 4000Rs extra for the same bag. The staff promised me that he will check with the finance department and revert back. But I haven't received any call yet. I find it unprofessional how such a large airline like Indigo can lose luggage.  To add insult to injury, I am faced with obtaining compensation for those items that are far less than their worth.",no

The ground staff and the cabin crew were really helpful and welcoming. The in-flight meal options were limited but it was a standard domestic flight like menu so no complaints there. The flight was tidy and the journey was very comfortable. The best part about the flight was the punctuality.

My tickets were under the category which cannot be rescheduled, so I panicked as the amount I paid was over 20000 rupees and with my previous experience with domestic airlines, I was sure I am losing all the money and would be asked to re-book the entire journey. Much fortunately, I called Indigo and got connected to this very helpful person who was so patient with my panic state and assisted me with all my queries and infact rescheduled the tickets considering they were booked a few minutes ago.

IndiGo,2,"""no options for hot meals""",S Marbanian,31st May 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Istanbul via Doha. We had booked the XL seats in the 1st row for Rs 1000 each considering the nearly 10 hours journey, but realized what a mistake that was. First of all, Indigo added a stopover in Doha, which meant a direct flight that was advertised as 8 hours duration at the time of booking, became nearly 10 hours. The seating configuration is identical to the domestic flights, with just a few more rows added in the back since the A321 is longer than the A320. This means that they use the same seats (with just about 4 cm of foam padding). The in-flight menu has no options for hot meals to be purchased, and the best food you can buy on-board is cup noodles made with hot water. Even Air Asia, which is a much more LCC provides options for passengers to purchase hot meals for all their flights. Additionally the flight does a 1 hour stopover at Doha during which they park in a remote bay, and open the doors for crew and cleaning. This means that if you are seated near the front of the plane, you will be exposed to hot desert winds of Qatar for about an hour. On top of this, even though the crew announce that certain rows such as the first row, emergency exits are paid seats, they do not do anything to prevent random people from sitting in these seats during the flight. Why on earth should anyone pay for these seats beforehand then, only to get scammed during the flight like this? On top of this, the crew treat the first row like the ""toilet waiting area"", since any passenger who is waiting in queue to use the toilet needs to be seated when the seatbelt sign is on. But the crew instead of sending them back to their seat, make them sit in the first row, which is a paid row.",no

Upon reaching the airport I was not allowed to print the boarding pass, they didn't have to give the boarding pass, just print the pdf that I had. The worst part is if they had not wasted my time in queues when I had already mentioned I was in a hurry, I could have gone outside and gotten a printout. I missed my flight just because I didn't have a printout of my boarding pass, even though I had the pdf. There has to be some understanding, they should guide us properly.",no

I have been in India for few months and travelled with Indigo few times, and I have always had a lovely experience until today. I’ve arrived to Kolkata. As I went to drop my bag at the check-in desk, a barrier was lower, so I took a shortcut and stepped over it. Straight after staff come up to me and with a intimidating attitude asked me: is everything ok?! At first I didn’t realise, but then I told me in that I should not step over the barrier as a matter of security. Honestly I felt very embarrassed, so I apologies. Few seconds after I saw some older guy doing it, but staff looked away. Then another guy did it in front of him, and staff smiled away. So I asked staff why it was ok for some people to do it and not for me? It was then become aggressive and rude, so I decide to let the argument go. He should be fair with all, no just pick arguments with foreigners so that he can feel good and embarrassing customer in front of all. I hope Indigo can address this with staff and provide him with a customer service training. He is the face of Indigo when people arrive at the airport, and people like him can ruin the reputation of Indigo. Then on the flight they didn’t have changed for cash payments and instead wanted me to buy more things. That was pathetic, they offer a service they should make sure they have changed, it was the first flight in the morning and I was seating 1st row and they didn’t have changes.",no

On the plane I finally realized and we started calling the lost and found at the airport in Hyderabad. They were closed because it was Sunday. In Rajahmundry we spoke with IndiGo personnel and the airport manager who helped me get hold of someone from the airline in Hyderabad and assure me that my articles are secure with them. They even offered to send my stuff via a next available flight but I was coming back the next day, so I was just willing to pick it up then. In Hyderabad staff were very pleasant and helpful and quickly gave me my articles after checking my identity. Someone from Indigo actually went to the security, got my stuff and kept it at the counter. Everyone went above and beyond and I quickly got everything back but knowing that my stuff was safe waiting for me on a Sunday night was very reassuring and stress relieving. Thank you, IndiGo staff.

The check-in was a breeze and boarding / departure started on time. The aircraft was well maintained and even though every seat was practically full, the crew did well to manage things and requests from fellow passengers. The seat pitch is around 30 inches which is decent enough but might be more uncomfortable for someone taller. The flight was very smooth and the crew were very pleasant and indulged in small talk among the passengers when it came for the in-flight snacks which were kind of pricey. Arrival was on time and the captain of the flight announced that this was his last flight and so all the passengers were requested to send their best wishes to the captain during de-boarding which was a nice touch.

Boarding was smooth no drama. Flight was ready for take off and at that time it was advise that there is problem with aircraft and hence the flight need to abandon and change of aircraft and brought aircraft back to gate. Spend another 3 hours and finally took off. I can say that they had managed transition very smoothly.

He invited us to an empty office where a short time later we were met by a doctor who examined my daughter and gave us medication and electrolytes. As a result my daughter's condition improved and we were able to take the flight after all. The help that we received was initiated by the attentive and very friendly Indigo Airlines staff.

On May 30th, 2018 my husband, mother and myself were supposed to catch our flight from Delhi to Goa with Indigo. However, the day before our flight we received a message stating that our terminal had changed due to renovations in the airport. My husband had called the airlines to confirm and was told that our terminal had in fact changed. Once we arrived at the Delhi airport, security wouldn’t let us inside the airport and he kept telling us we were in the wrong terminal. We told him that the airlines themselves had confirmed about the terminal change, but he still didn’t want to let us in and asked us to go to the Indigo customer care outside of the airport. When we went inside the customer service area it was already packed with other passengers and we had to wait a long time before we were greeted by the only one Indigo agent that was there. After we explained the situation to the gentleman, he called his manager to help us. The manager took at least 15-20 minutes before he came down (after the agent called numerous times). When we re-explained the situation the manager told us he can’t help us and left mid-conversation, baffling both my husband and I with such horrible customer service, especially from someone in management, The manager left another agent to “deal” with us that was even less helpful. By this time, boarding to the plane had started and we were still stuck with the agent telling us she couldn’t do anything. We asked instead of giving us full credit to book us another flight and we would pay the difference but she did not want to do that. She said we will have to pay in full for the flights and we would not be reimbursed. By this time, all early flights were gone, and by the time we finally checked ourselves to book another flight with another airlines all flights to Goa for May 30th were booked. We booked our flight with Fly Air for 6 times the original price and had to book a hotel for another night at Delhi. We called the hotel in Goa to advise them we wouldn’t make it to the hotel that day, but rather the following afternoon and asked if we would be able to get a credit for that day, but unfortunately we couldn’t. Because of the service from Indigo airlines and wrong information given to us by them, we had to spend 6 times the price of our original flights, lost 1 day of hotel in Goa and had to book another extra night in Delhi.",no

I took around 1 minute to pull up those details on my MacBook - a reasonable time frame however the agent in charge elected to close the flight, instructed our boarding passes be ripped up and even though I showed the departure details was met with a sorry flight closed approach and checkin agents walking away.

Tried to do so online but in vain, the online portal just returned cryptic error messages. Sent an Email to Customer Service asking for advise to change flights as its not possible online. Promptly, on Jan 4th received a response which was completely unrelated and misleading, incl the proposal to contact their domestic call center for further help. Went down to their local agent & explained the issue. Nevertheless they talked me though the online process again. When I was about to leave their office I was told that online modifications only work using the Google Chrome browser. Just cancelled the entire booking and won't consider IndiGo ever again even without ever flying with them. What a terrible airline.",no

No screening of appropriate timings or scheduled departure. No announcements to confirm delays. We were rerouted to Mangalore but had to stay in Mangalore without any compensation.,no
IndiGo,1,IndiGo customer review,B Gamesani,12th February 2019,✅ Trip Verified |  Chennai to Singapore. I faced a nightmare with the booking I made with this airline for later in January 2019. One of the worst booking system this airline is using. I faced 3 times payment declined with international credit cards. One time payment deducted and took several days to get the refund. Again I had nightmare when I tried to purchase seat selection via visa CC issued by overseas bank.  I never had such a bad experience in 20 years of travelling.,no

IndiGo,1,"""52 mins to receive the luggage""",Sandeep Kulkarni,21st December 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Pune to Ahmedabad. Although Indigo is good in time management and on time departure, they have deteriorated in terms of customer service.  Although the flight was on time, it took 52 mins to receive the luggage. Also it was surprising that they put the luggage of two adjacently arriving flights on the same belt. This is just not to allow the belt to remain empty. The luggage keeps coming so much less in number and the passengers keep staring at the belt expecting their luggage to come.The attitude of the ground staff is rude.  Also the crew members are not friendly enough.  KPI of ""on time"" is important as a performance indicator but should not be at the cost of passenger satisfaction.",no

Indigo crew were super friendly and the flight was pretty comfortable. Service was good and attendants responded to requests, although the aircraft was nearly full.

And the airlines sends an email to me on 4th that they had changed the schedule of my flight from Bangalore to evening 5.55 pm. I do not understand , why nobody from the airlines did not bother to check when my return flight was and why they did not call me and instead just sent an email. Luckily, i checked my mail on sunday the 4th, otherwise my whole travel plan would have been jeopardized. And when i call the support number, that person says there are two options - 1. He can cancel and refund or change the flight to take flights with layover in between And when i said i need to be in Vizag in the morning, he suggested a flight in the midnight i.e at 00.05 hours from Bangalore to Chennai and that the connecting flight to Vizag would be from Chennai in the morning at 6.50 i.e with a layover of 5 hours and when i asked if indigo can make any lounge arrangement for those 5 hours, he says that Indigo cannot help in that regard and that i need to take care of the stay during the layover. Since the airline changed the flight schedule, they should at least compensate with an arrangement to stay during the layover -  (if we change they charge difference or if we cancel, they have t&c that there will be percentage deduction in the refunded amount. But if it is their fault they do not bother about what the passenger is going through)",no
IndiGo,1,"""inflexible airline and understaffed""",P Singh,21st December 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely inflexible airline and understaffed. There was a misprint in the name due to auto-correct. I showed 3 different IDs (passport, driver's license from India, driver's license from another country) so that they can correct my name but to no avail. They are completely understaffed and unprofessional about handling the case. It took 40 minutes just to reach the ticketing counter to explain my case and then I was left with over 1 hour before departure. Rather than trying to fix the issue, they were just trying to get more money by asking me to book a fresh ticket. Since this was happening 1 hour before departure, I could not even cancel my ticket. Had they been quick about it, I could have corrected the issue and boarded the flight. But instead, I had to book a new ticket for an airline later in the day and lost money on the previous one too. With a security lapse, I was allowed in the airport(name on ID not matching my ticket). This was surprising in the first place. Rather taking this case to fix their security issues, they were still bent on just asking me to book a fresh ticket. No wonder there is a huge room for improvement. But instead of fixing those, the involved people are just concerned about extracting money from consumers. Absolutely unsatisfied with the situation.",no
IndiGo,1,"""measuring the handbags""",H Gadesse,4th October 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying from Dubai to Bangalore and the luggage policy is 30 kgs check-in and 7 kgs hand luggage.  My check-in luggage was 22 kgs and I thought I would move my extra kgs to the check-in, but at the check-in counter, even though I put both pieces of luggage together the guy told me, it’s ok, you can put it down and didn’t ask to measure my hand luggage which is what they normally do. However, after immigration and security, just when I was about to board the flight, they had another scale and were measuring the handbags and wanted me to pay 60 AED (1100 Rs) per kg. They said if I don’t pay I cannot get on the flight. They were even charging people for stuff they bought in Duty-free.",no

However, unfortunately, we still missed our flights.We walked in when the flight status was still showing as ""boarding"", there were no last/final call shown on the flight status. We were not let to board because we were ""3 mins late"" for boarding. We were unaware that the CCU airport is a silent airport as other Indigo flight boarding were announced since we were listening intently awaiting our boarding call. We saw the last bus standing and we pleaded to let us in, the woman officer wanted us to let in but the male officer was arrogant and said no. The moment they heard that we are foreigners, they realized their mistake but they did nothing to correct it or help us out in any manner. They took the time to send back our luggage instead. Finally, we had to get fresh new tickets from another airlines that cost us Rs 5,900 additionally. Other than this incident, our entire flight experience was good. I hope that this matter is looked into and taken care of.",no

So after a long wait someone turned up with a child's wheelchair! I'm 6 foot plus! After a further long wait a wheelchair turned up.

However, the flight crew done everything by calmly and professionally organizing medical attention.

IndiGo,1,"""wouldn’t recommend""",G Eardly,4th October 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I had the opportunity to fly with IndiGo on the 15th of August 2018 from Doha to Mumbai. Always having flown Qatar Airways I had to choose IndiGo due to the time slot. Well, a low cost airline in really had no expectations but at least a decent and hassle free experience as they claim to give. I checked in at the counters and got my boarding pass and I had a handbag of 6kgs which is well below their limit of 7kgs. I purchased duty free which was about 3 kgs. Here comes the tricky part the staff at the boarding gate have a portable weighing scale through which they check the weight of the handbags. I have no issues with that however I wasn’t informed at the counters about 7kgs handbag allowance being inclusive of duty free. The staff at the boarding gate (QAS) staff, were rude they do not even try to be polite of courteous and straight away give ultimatums saying throw away the duty free, go back to duty free and return it, however if you do no return in 20 minutes we will offload you from the flight. They forced me to pay 60 riyal per kg for the excess baggage which I was carrying. I wouldn’t recommend this airline unless a last resort or a complete emergency. One can only expect low quality service from a low cost airline. Thank you IndiGo for the hassle free experience.",no

I have flown with Indigo loads of times and have regularly recommended it to many. I have never had a bad experience in all of my trips and was really happy until my recent trip. I had booked my seats under student discount which allowed an additional baggage of 10kgs free of charge. During my through leg from DEL to CJB, this promotion was honored and I paid for whatever excess I had, (excluding the 15kg+10kg allowance). But they would not agree that I had this promotion during my return leg and would not agree or believe me that I availed this in my first leg. I was astounded when the rep said there was nothing in the notes regarding the promotion. How can it be possible that you allow different baggage allocations for different legs. I ended up paying for the excess baggage which I had packed in anticipation of availing the 10 kg student discount. It was never about the money for me, but Indigo let me down in not acknowledging my promotion status.",no
IndiGo,10,"""Indigo is such a great airline""",Suramya Naik,4th October 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was travelling from Delhi to Vadodara in July 2018 through Indigo. Unfortunately, our flight from San Francisco to Delhi (Via Shanghai) got delayed and we missed the 5:10 am flight from Delhi to Vadodara. The Indigo staff at terminal 2 acted very helpful. They offered me to book in the next flight to Vadodara with minimal fee of fare difference, but unfortunately it was in the afternoon and not very convenient to us (as we were tired of traveling from SFO and really wanted to get home to as fast as possible). There was a flight to Ahmedabad at 7:40 am and we urged the Indigo staff to book us in that flight. They mentioned that the 'sector' (i.e. destination) was different and therefore the change fees would be higher. I said no issue as we were really in hurry. There was another problem though. That flight was from terminal 1 and it was already 6:20 am. The indigo staff suggested to go to terminal 1 first and then get my ticket changed there because there was no sufficient time and if I would get the tickets changed and then again miss the flight, I would lose more money. They offered me their shuttle to take me from terminal 2 to terminal 1. But with little time, we did not have time to wait for the shuttle and we just took the taxi. We barely reached to Terminal at 6:35 am. We had to get our tickets modified, checked in and boarding passes printed by 6:40 am to get into the Ahemdabad flight. That is when we met staff who had just joined her duties at the terminal 1 ticket counter and saw us coming with family in agitated state. I requested her to change my tickets to allow me to get Ahmedabad flight. She immediately realized that we needed urgent help and started working furiously to get the tickets changed and printed. In couple of minutes we had our tickets in hand and we rushed to the terminal 1 departure entrance. She ran with us to the entrance and requested the police to let us in fast. Then we ran to check-in area, she opened a new counter just to process our checkin and print our boarding passes. We could get the boarding passes just in time! Then she ran with us to the security area, asked other indigo staff to take us through the security fast and get us to the gate. We got to the gate as last passengers entering! We could not have done it without this staff. We now realized why Indigo is such a great airline. it is because of the great employees.",yes

Although their in-flight menu is bit expensive, one can bring their food from home also, which also save some money. From ground handling to the crews' services, it was an excellent service. The students fare scheme is a boon indeed. Being a student, I always prefer this airlines as they offer not only 6% basic fare discount but also 10 kg free baggage allowance.

IndiGo,2,"""Lack of flexibility""",S Richardson,27th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I travel with Indigo a lot and about half the time I regret it. They have all sorts of arbitrary rules that don't affect their ability to do their job but do affect your flight experience. For example, a few times I've arrived to my flight early due to a changing work schedule in time to take their previous flight going the same way on the same day. Every time they refuse despite having plenty of space - apparently they cannot tolerate changing my flight despite the fact that it would save me 4 hours of being away from my family and cost them nothing. Today they made me check my carry on because it was 8kg and over their limit of 7kg. Why do they care if that 8kg is carried in my hand or under the plane? Lack of flexibility and customer orientation on this airline is consistently staggeringly bad. And it really irritates my sense of efficiency and reasonableness.",no

We explained that we were transiting at Singapore so did not need a visa. They refused to accept. I explained that at Singapore it is possible to freely transfer between terminals T2 & T3 without needing to pass Immigration. They refused to agree and insisted we required a Singapore visa. After much discussion they allowed us to board after they realized we possessed valid US & other visas. Wereached Singapore and there is no requirement to pass Immigration.

Apart from one or two exceptions, every time the flight I booked was cancelled and I was re-booked on another flight. It was alright when the re-booking was done for another flight at the same time but lately the re-booked flights are at very inconvenient times. As a female passenger traveling alone, I could not accept the revised time of 21.50 reaching my destination at 23.05 for my last booked flight. The only other alternative for me is a flight one day later. Not to mention the unexpected delays in airport. I do not recommend IndiGo flights.

The Indigo staff at the Mumbai airport were very helpful in arranging to board the aircraft at the last moment. She was travelling alone and had no knowledge of Hindi. The Ground staff of Indigo also arranged to send her luggage in another aircraft travelling to Chennai. We had a few tense moments till she arrived safely here at Chennai.

As always exemplary cabin service, efficient check in service. This time had a harrowing experience that the airline handled with aplomb: I checked in and was asked if I had a PowerPac in my luggage and I said no. While waiting at the departure gate to board, the IndiGo agent called me over and said that there was a problem with my check-in luggage and that there was something ""suspicious"" inside. They asked me to exit security (surrendering my passport at Immigration and having my boarding pass cancelled). An IndiGo employee accompanied me to the bowels of the airport where my luggage had been held. I opened it up and what had aroused the scanner operator's suspicions was a litre of oil I was carrying. They opened the container examined it declared it ""passed"" and I re-locked my luggage. All this time I was very nervous that I might miss my flight. The IndiGo employee who accompanied me throughout this ordeal assured me that I would not. He re-escorted me through security and immigration where a new boarding pass awaited me. He assuaged my nervousness, stayed with me till I went through security and Immigration again, escorted me to the plane where I was the last passenger to board! A exemplary and totally extraordinary performance by an IndiGo employee who stayed with me during the entire ordeal. Many many thanks.

The check-in process was smooth and the baggage handling went well. I later found out as I had a ""Lite"" ticket, which was cheaper, I had to pay extra for my checked baggage. I did that. A bus took us to our aircraft. The plane was loaded and it took off exactly on time. The seats were a bit tight and legroom wasn't that good so I was a bit uncomfortable for a 2hr long flight. The head-rest of the seat also wasn't that comfortable. But you know, you can't expect that much in economy and the aircraft was also of a narrow-body type. With Indigo, you have to pay for food if you are flying economy, I ordered coffee and a Tandoori chicken Sandwich. From my judgement, the cost was a bit much for food of that quality. The sandwich was cold. You even have to call flight attendants for water every time, which in my opinion, would be much simpler if they just gave you a bottle. The plane's air-conditioning had troubles, so it was a bit hot. At last, the plane landed on New Delhi after 2hr 5min. Experience could have been a little better even if it was economy-class.",yes

During that time, these are the things that I felt about the airline. 1) Check In: The Lines were long, the number of counters were pretty reasonable but could be increased considering the number of flights IndiGo operates. My advice, arrive early. 2) Aircraft: Neat. Clean aircraft. No problems. 3) Crew service: Pretty good. Up to standards. 4) Ground Support: I didn't face any trouble and the staff were pretty helpful too. 5) On Board Meal: it's not complementary. You have to buy it. Tasted good for the money. 6) Punctuality: On-time. No issues there. 7) Communications: Book online. You would get all the information via SMS, even the boarding gate information.",yes
IndiGo,5,"""quite careless these days""",Shubhi Singh,26th February 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chennai to Raipur via Hyderabad. Indigo is being quite careless these days, they mess up things and all we get to hear is ""sorry for the inconvenience mam"". Recently While booking the tickets i had selected a XL seat for my father according to his comfort and convenience and had paid for it in advance, but still indigo somehow managed to sell all the XL seats including my father's, so today when we went to get our boarding passes, they said sorry mam, all seats are full and then they made me go here and there but in the end all they said is, you will have to manage and we will try to refund your money. Its not about money but the inconvenience which my father had to go through. Why have a feature of prior booking the desired seats if you people can't handle it properly.",yes

My flight 6E 464 was scheduled for departure at 9:20am on 30 December and is finally boarding at 3:45 pm. In between this many flights for Mumbai has flown and Indigo crew remained clueless about this particular flight and spoke rude to passengers who we're enquiring. After the delay till 2:40pm the airline stopped sending any information to passengers via SMS or call.  At some point we were thinking as if we were waiting for some imaginary flight!  The refreshments were announced only at 12:30pm when most passengers had arranged their meals.,no

I am still not sure how long it would take me to finally board my flight today. I have a family event to attend but I think I won't be able to attend it.  It would be a customer delight if airline respects passengers valuable time and value for money. I have been a valued indigo customer but today I am sorry to say indigo customer centric ideologies are fading away these days.,no

Indigo provided no help getting onto the flight to Mumbai on Nov, 15. She had to walk to the gate. They issued the boarding pass but didn't wait for us and closed the gate 35 minutes before departure. They then charged me extra Rs.6500 to get us on to another flight. I have noticed the exact same happening to another senior citizen couple at the Mumbai airport on Nov 28th. When I objected they issued two tickets to the couple for free. Indigo seems to be cheating elderly people using this technique.",no

IndiGo,1,"""final flight I will book with IndiGo""",Bergen Stephen,26th February 2018,✅ Trip Verified | Had one of the worst experiences with IndiGo during a very critical moment. We had booked our flight 3 months ago. Our flight was from Trivandrum to Patna via Bengaluru. While we wer in Thiruvananthapuram we got a phone call from IndiGo 2 days prior to our departure saying that one my flights has been canceled and other one rescheduled. I was suppose to leave Trivandrum at 8:00 am and reach Patna by 3:00pm afternoon and we had to travel all the way to Nepal in order to attend a meeting on the very next day. IndiGo screwed us very bad and said they will provide us with a different flight but both on separate days. Now I am here in Trivandrum airport one day earlier to my actual departure and waiting for my flight which has been delayed once again. Now I will reach Bengaluru at midnight where I have to stay for 12 hours waiting for my next flight. Now my time and money are completely wasted. Staying over night in Bengaluru costs minimum ₹5000 and on top I'm stuck here wasting my time when I had to attend a party. This will be last and final flight that I will book with IndiGo.,no

As usual on this run, a route I have flown close to 30 times in the past 6 years, an almost-flawless flight. The only problem being no arrival cards on board for non-Indian nationals thus needlessly spending a much longer time in queue at Kolkata immigration. Other than that, an impeccable flight, especially the superb cabin crew.",yes
IndiGo,1,"""as a worst experience""",Gaurav Surwade,20th November 2017,✅ Verified Review |  Goa to Mumbai. It was a worst experience we had at Goa airport while travelling back to Bombay. We got to Indigo counter at 43mins prior. However we were denied for boarding as we were 2 mins late and were asked to pay difference of 10500Rs for next flight. We tried requesting the ground staff but they were arrogant and didn't show any respect or courtesy. It seemed like we have to live on their mercy to get on board to get back to Bombay. As it was way below self respect we decided to book another flight with Air India and got back home. It was most inferior action by the Indigo staff which could have been avoided.,no

The seat was well cramped the storage area was good, its a budget airlines with the cost of ticket of a normal airlines, only benefit was that we have 30 kgs each. The storage area on above the seats was pretty wide. Staff and service was pretty average - average experience.",no
IndiGo,10,"""friendly and professional""",G Marezy,20th November 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Trivandrum. We had a eventful day flying from Dubai to Trivandrum, first upon check in we were told that we lacked a return ticket out of the country so our visa would not be valid. The check in lady was very friendly and explained it very calmly. So my son and I went to book a flight out of the country, returned to the check in counter, where the lady saw us and waved us over and let us jump the que. We proceeded to security where the staff was friendly and gave clear directions to passengers who did not know the rules yet. After security however things got exciting again, while presenting our boarding pass I heard the staff talk to each other and we were told there was something in our bag that caught their attention. All was said in an extremely friendly manner while we racked our brains trying to imagine what was in the suitcase. I was allowed down to the tarmac where I opened the suitcase and it was examined, it turned out to be a door stop I brought? The staff were friendly during all of this and let us into the plane with a smile. The flight itself was very nice the seats were more comfortable and spacious then our previous flights with Pegasus. All in all the staff was extremely friendly and professional.",yes

Service on board consisted of one cup of water. Seats narrow with not much legroom, which guaranteed very close contact to the neighbors.

The flight was delayed by 90 minutes in total and instead of arriving at 10.30pm we arrived at 12.05am. We had requested a wheelchair for our mother and whilst getting off the aeroplane as we approached the gate, we were advised to go back and sit. As the passengers were coming through the passage we couldn't make our way back to the seats. The air hostesses were extremely rude, repeatedly asked us to go back to the seats although there was no possible way to get back to the seats. They were just not willing to listen and talking in an extremely humiliating tone. They asked us all to leave behind our mother with one person which made the rest of us further anxious. In summary an extremely annoying experience, air hostesses who are expected to be kind and helpful were extremely rude, intolerant and unwilling to listen.",no
IndiGo,9,"""would definitely recommend""",Anjay Krishnamurthy,20th November 2017,"✅ Verified Review | The service has been consistently good. Easily the best airline for domestic travel within India. In my experience they have been on time every single time (6 - 7 times a year that I flew). Extra legroom seats are charged nominally, no business class. Decent choice of snacks and beverages (no alcohol), crew are very professional and friendly. The aircraft could do with some inflight entertainment though. Would definitely recommend this airline to anyone visiting India or flying out.",yes

This is my third experience with same flight - flight is delayed by 1hr 10mins, last time when I travelled a month before then it was delayed by 2 hours this is really horrible. Generally this flight is taken by one who attends office whole day and then come for flight and you face this issue again and again. Indigo will lose it's reputation if they continue to do so.",no

They had a flight via Mumbai where flight was to be changed. The ticket was under single PNR, I confirmed with customer care if the luggage will be through checked in & he confirmed it would be done. But at the time of check in, the officer denied & started asking me the name of person who confirmed. Now, who remembers the name of customer care executive! So, I had to take the luggage in Mumbai & check-in again. With no other option, I did take the luggage. The gap between the 2 flight was of about 3 hours. I was supposed to be transferred to International airport. When I asked the ground staff to arrange transfer, they were clueless & asked me to go out, hire a taxi & leave. I got upset, but instead of helping me, the Mumbai ground staff kept on arguing. The taxi took a good time to reach International airport, as it was peak hour. Finally we could make it just in time only to find that the flight was delayed. This is the first time I have seen that international flight booked under one PNR from an airline website. No through check-in, No transfers,when both the flights are from same airline. Basic flight, No service, No entertainment, expensive Food.",no

This was my first flight with IndiGo and I was accompanied with my sister and her three children (2 kids and 1 infant). At Check-In we were given priority due to family. I was informed that they won't be able to accommodate us in one row as the seats were full. On my request, the Lady at the counter talked to her Supervisor and allotted us seats in the first row (which are paid seats) without any extra fee. That was really surprising and too generous of them. The boarding was smooth, the aircraft was clean and the food (paid) was good. It was a comfortable flight with very attentive and hospitable cabin crew. Even the ground staff was very helpful and courteous. The flight was on time and luggage reclaim was almost smooth. IndiGo definitely lived up-to it's tagline of on-time budget airline. Would definitely love to fly it again.",yes

The flight was on time. However there a strange high pitched sound just before take off which lasted for 5-10 minutes and the AC stopped working until the flight took off. The sound was again heard during landing too. The baggage at conveyer belt after the flight landed was messed up. On the same belt there was back to back baggage for 3 flights which was cumbersome and troublesome. I had to stand at the belt for an hour waiting to receive my luggage, it was very crowded with people looking for bags. Ground service was poor.",no
IndiGo,4,"""comfort might be a difficulty""",V Andrews,12th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Mumbai on Indigo Airbus A321. Had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online, we went to the airport directly. However, it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes, there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks. This issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline. The flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure. The seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame, then comfort might be a difficulty. As this is a low cost carrier, meals and snacks such as sandwiches (both veg and non-vegetarian), tea/coffee and cup noodles were offered. As I had booked this flight with a corporate meal, a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff. The sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can. After the snack, unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result, it got even more cramped. To be fair to the crew, they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency. Flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft, the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers. The positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency. On the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame, the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem. Their in-flight magazine Hello 6E had some articles but was by and large, an in-shop magazine. Would I fly with them again? Maybe on very short routes which are dirt cheap, but would rather prefer the full service carriers instead.",no

A caveat: In a hundred international flights into Bangkok in the past two decades, for the first time ever in my experience, an airline (IndiGo) did not have Thai immigration forms.

Smooth boarding from Bangkok. Impeccable onboard service und attitude. Chaotic boarding at Kolkata: a long queue formed at boarding. Fine. Then an announcement was made by a ground staff member, in a voice that could barely be heard that rows 16-30 would board first. Since the announcement was barely audible, people waiting in the queue were confused, thus standing in line, not knowing what to do. Ground crew member - only one IndiGo staff manning their pre-boarding desk/area - did not repeat announcement and just stood by looking around and not allowing anyone to board. People waiting. In the meantime some passengers not in the queue approached this confused ground staff person, spoke to him and were allowed to board. No idea if these people were going to occupy rows 16-30. Nothing happening; line not moving; IndiGo staff still looking as if he was in a daze. No repeat announcement, in an audible voice, re rows 16-30. Since I was in line, had a seat in row 21, I broke the queue, presented my boarding pass, and passed security. Don't know what happened after that. IndiGo needs to get its act together in this area.

The outward journey started with a smooth and easy check in at Mumbai. Flight on time. The aircraft was clean and as per Indigo standards. What was very poor on this flight was the crew. The leading stewardess in particular seemed to sit and do not much while the other crew worked. Shame to see Indigo crew standards falling. It was also a morning flight but they had none of the breakfast options available - Ramen noodles were my best option. Return flight had a great crew but the Delhi airport check in was a nightmare.

Indigo has been my personal favourite for short flights. The flight crew is fairly good. I'm 6'1, and I find the seat compact but this is the same for all LCCs and not ideal on long flights. Cabin staff appearance is smart, they are courteous but not always consistent. There is no inflight entertainment on these flights.

Booking in its website was easy and prices were competetive. Check-in at the airports was easy and fast - Indigo had many counters open in all 3 airports. Flights departured with no delays of more than 5 minutes. The airplanes looked new and very clean. Staff was nice and helpful. On two occasions I ordered a sandwich (about 250 rupees) which was quiet tasty to my surprise. The only downside that I can think of is that the seats are not very comfortable, but it's a low cost airline and flights usually last only 1-2 hours, so it's not such a big deal.

The landing was a smooth one and the pilot kept us well-informed about the delays. The food was delicious and it was a very enjoyable flight. I will have a pleasure flying with IndiGo again.,yes
IndiGo,1,"""worst experience so far""",E Malhotra,30th July 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Delhi to Hyderabad with IndiGo. While I'm writing this, I'm waiting to make the payment for excess luggage. The problem is, it's been 40 minutes, and having been moved from one counter to another, three times, I'm still stuck in a state wondering if I'll ever get my boarding pass for an already delayed flight. I've travelled on pretty much every domestic airline that operates in India. This is my worst experience so far. Unlikely I'll ever buy a ticket with Indigo again.",no
IndiGo,4,"""seats not that comfortable""",A Pandesh,30th July 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Cochin to Delhi with IndiGo, flight was late by 1 hour due to incoming aircraft arriving late.  Seat was 13E(XL). Seats not that comfortable and cushioning is very hard. Had the instant noodles which was tasty along with Cappuccino which is always hot and tasty. Service was okay. At DEL, baggage took a long time to come.",no
IndiGo,9,"""flight experience always been good""",Avi Singh,30th July 2016,"Pune to Lucknow via New Delhi. I have flown every low cost airline in India and I find Indigo the best. Their booking is hassle free through app on both ios and android. Web check-in is a breeze, getting any optional services is also good. The check-in is curteous and to the point. Mind you they dont allow even 1kg extra on planes without payment, plus they have also started to screen weight of cabin bag just before boarding the flight. Its a business model because they are a budget airline. The planes are clean with courteous crew. The leg space of economy seats is ample. I am a heavy built person and I have never faced space crunch in the seats. The in-flight food is okay, nothing to write about. I never had to wait for my baggage for more than 10 min. Overall the flight experience has always been good.",yes
IndiGo,10,"""flight experience  was good""",Harshwardhan Sharma,30th July 2016,The overall flight experience from Delhi to Visakhapatnam via Hyderabad was good compare to other airlines.The seats were comfortable and spacious. The food was nice but there was no In Flight entertainment.I suggest Indigo to Have InFlight entertainment.,yes
IndiGo,5,"""ambience was pleasant""",Chandan Kodgirwar,30th July 2016,Overall experience with Indigo flight from Delhi to Pune is good compared to others which I have travelled. Cabin space and seating arrangement is better than others. Overall ambience was pleasant. I think Indigo could enhance their service by adding some information devices inside the cabin showing a route map and if possible some outside coverage such as cameras. They could also offer Indian food during meal times rather than junk food.,yes
IndiGo,10,"""a flawless flight""",H Advani,30th July 2016,"Sometimes I seem to be repeating myself - travel from Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata 3-4 times yearly - but, once again, a flawless flight from IndiGo. Something I have written about in the past, the fact that the on board crew never has any Arrival Forms for foreigners, was finally rectified but, however, with an amusing twist: on my asking the cabin attendant for an Arrival Form, something that only non-Indian nationals need to fill, she very pertly asked me as to why I needed one since I look Indian. I replied that I was only 99.99% Indian, the remaining .01% being American as I carry that country's passport. (I did not mention that the Indian diaspora is the largest in the world. I was, however, tempted to do so.) P.S Food and beverages have to be purchased on IndiGo. I never comment on these as I usually carry aboard lots of munchies/snackies.",yes
IndiGo,8,"""well-trained and helpful""",Dhruv Bhatt,30th July 2016,Mumbai to Jaipur. I am a frequent flyer on this particular route. I prefer a low-cost flight on this route as the journey time is just 2 hrs. IndiGo is not a full-service carrier but one thing is for sure if you are booking an IndiGo flight be sure that you reach on time. They have a record of on time departures. The ground crew and cabin crew is well-trained and swift and helpful. The only place where this airline lacks is the entertainment system. The magazines provided inside are good enough if you are in India for a vacation or a tour. The airline connects almost each and every airport of India. Also they are flying to some international destinations like Dubai. They also provide free reminder service for your flight and the communication system between airline and consumers is way too good. The meals served are ready to cook meals and some snacks also available with good range of beverages.,yes
IndiGo,2,"""yet another bad experience""",Gunjan Singh,26th January 2016,Yet another bad experience with Indigo from Udaipur to Mumbai. We arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure. We were told that seats were all web checked in so we were forced to take paid seats or sit in different rows. Concept of unregulated extra charges within economy class is wrong. Moreover these are not declared at the time of booking tickets.,no
IndiGo,8,"""punctual and comfortable""",Ravi Mene,26th January 2016,"Pune to Nagpur with IndiGo. The plane was new, check in was smooth, boarding systematic, they are the only airline who use walkway to board the aircraft, this is better than using steps as PNQ airport does not use its airbridges for every flight. FA were smartly turned out and professional. The onboard trolley had snacks and beverages for purchase. The flights were punctual and comfortable.",yes
IndiGo,10,"""was very impressed""",Thomas Zasso,26th January 2016,"Delhi to Goa, and I flew three times with IndiGo. The planes are new and clean, and staff very professional. Seats are large and comfortable. The pilots communicate well with the passengers. Flights were on time. They have shuttle buses which bring you to the plane. Check-in was fast and smooth, and you can bring along 2 check-in bags with no extra charge. I was very impressed as I was not sure what to expect.",yes
IndiGo,3,"""I missed my flight""",Zavier Murtza,26th January 2016,"Bangalore to Pune. A lack of organisational and communication skills and ticket counter staff had no idea how to handle awkward customers. I arrived at the airport with enough time to check in, the counter staff was dealing with a customer who missed her flight and this lasted over 15 minutes and meant that even though I was fast tracked to the front of queue I missed my flight - despite the flight not departing for another 40 minutes. I was told that I had to rebook a fresh flight at the cost of 17,500INR, which was then reduced to 3,600INR after I complained and explained the situation.",no
IndiGo,10,"""would fly them again""",M Sekhri,26th January 2016,"Flew Delhi to Mumbai and the first time I tried Indigo, via my travel broker. I have flown SpiceJet and Jet Airways and didn't really enjoy my experience with them, so I was keen to try another option. Pleasantly surprised on all fronts: customer service, flights were on-time and the inflight food was good. Seats were good sized as well, not as crammed as Spicejet. I would fly them again.",yes
IndiGo,6,"""all flights on time""",Prayash Giria,26th January 2016,"Flew various domestic flights with IndiGo through last year. All flights on time, never more than a ten minute delay, and they have a fairly comprehensive network.  Food was poor, choices often not available. Prices are no longer cheap. Staff is competent but not that courteous. They use bus boarding even at terminals where airbridges are empty which is irritating.",yes
IndiGo,5,"""long admired Indigo""",S Shetty,26th January 2016,"Bombay to Ahmedabad return I have long admired Indigo for it's focus on providing on-time service at a decent price with seats which are reasonably comfortable. I never minded paying the fee for better seats in the first row or exit row or for food which is against decent and I recommended it to many. However after a gap of over a year, I flew Indigo again and found the seats so thin, and the fares were not that decent compared to some carriers.",no
IndiGo,8,"""recommend IndiGo""",Chinar Dankhara,26th January 2016,"Port Blair to Delhi via Kolkata. The check in process required more time than expected. The staff was average. Seats were quite comfortable and aisle access was fair. Reliable airline and never been delayed. Food was available on request and is not included in the flight ticket. In flight entertainment was fair. I would recommend IndiGo for budget travellers, solo and family.",yes
IndiGo,8,"""service and aircraft up to the mark""",Scherazade Irani,26th January 2016,"I have flown with IndiGo on several occasions domestically and this was my first international flight with them. Seamless check in with very polite ground staff. Cabin crew were polite, pleasant and efficient. The aircraft was clean, even the lavatories were kept fairly clean. Choice of food onboard to be purchased was decent. DXB-BOM had a long check in queue but the process however was efficient. Onboard service and aircraft cleanliness was up to the mark. Seats are pretty comfortable, as they're slimmer hence providing a better amount of leg space. Departures/arrivals on time.",yes
IndiGo,10,"""another flawless flight""",H Advani,26th January 2016,"Another flawless flight with IndiGo. Returned to Thailand ten days ago and flew from Pune to Bangkok with a plane change at Kolkata. (Layover time about 2 hours.) Smooth check-in (Pune and Cal), smooth boarding at both places, and very smooth and comfy flight with the always-friendly, efficient and helpful cabin crew. On time departure and arrival a few minutes early. I like the use of a ramp in Pune while getting on/off IndiGo planes. So much easier than steps/stairs. Clicked N/A on food and bev, these are available but I have never tried them.",yes
IndiGo,9,"""staff are very kind""",Ramesh Chidamparam,28th November 2015,"Chennai to Singapore with IndiGo. Very nice seat, staff are very kind and smile faces.

IndiGo,10,"""so comfortable and smooth""",Amrita Kishore,28th November 2015,I am grateful to IndiGo for making my journey so comfortable and smooth. I traveled with IndiGo from Patna to Pune via Delhi. I had a pleasant flight experience and I'd like to commend staff on an exceptional level of service.  The staffs that we encountered were extremely polite.  Thanks to porters for being a great help and carrying my hand baggage. I'd like to mention staff who came with chocolates and biscuits and offered it to all kids as it was children's day! It was a very sweet gesture on part of IndiGo to come up with such ideas. Keep up the good work.,yes
IndiGo,10,"""a superb experience""",H Advani,28th November 2015,"A superlative experience. Flew Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata with IndiGo. Waited at the baggage carousel (very short wait). Had checked in two items: a bag and a long cardboard tube containing prints. The former arrived at the carousel; the latter did not. Enquired from IndiGo staff attending at and they informed me that since the tube was marked 'fragile' it would arrive separately very shortly (which it did) and asked me if I was connecting to an IndiGo flight and on my answering, yes, I was, IndiGo said they will assign staff member to escort me and my luggage to domestic departures. A lady took charge of me and my luggage - she insisted on pushing my trolley, I insisted on doing it myself; I won - and took me all the way to IndiGo x-ray security. As I was carrying a bottle of duty-fee liquor in my carry on, and since liquor cannot be carried on domestic flights, I checked my back pack through x-ray and the IndiGo staff, to avoid bottle smashing, tied my backpack up very securely and put a fragile tag on it and asked the staff escorting me to inform IndiGo check in counter, where the pack was specially tagged and given to a baggage handler to carry it personally into the baggage room. A superb experience!",yes
IndiGo,9,"""well functioning LCC""",Debasish Chatterjee,28th November 2015,"Overall, a very good flying experience with IndiGo. Flights on time. Boarding experience good.

IndiGo,9,"""food was absolutely delicious""",Anurag Dave,28th November 2015,"Flew Indigo from BDQ to CCU via DEL. The IndiGo has some of the most courteous and helpful FAs. Despite the fact that my family didn't get seats together, FAs helped us swap seats with other passengers. FAs are also very kid-friendly. The meal service in IndiGo economy class is better than the meal service of every US-carrier on domestic routes. The food was absolutely delicious. During Delhi transit, we were asked to stay in our seats while the crew changed and cabin was cleaned for on-going flight to Kolkata. We were offered additional snacks while we were waiting inside the cabin. Our experience on DEL-CCU segment was also excellent. The only IndiGo process that I find to be strange is when they check your boarding pass as you disembark the aircraft.",yes

From checking in to the cabin crew to smiling pilots who say byebye when leaving the plane. The planes are clean, the seating is fine (I am 5'10"" and slim) as each flight is around 2-1/2 hours. Boarding is efficiently done, and every departure and arrival was on time. The fact that baggage takes time to arrive is probably beyond the airline's control.",yes
IndiGo,8,"""comfortable and very clean""",Adnan Mir,28th November 2015,Morning Flight from Singapore to Chennai. Arrived at check in three hours early and had no checked in baggage so check in was smooth and quick. Boarding was also very quick and professional. Upon boarding I changed my seat from where I was sitting in the front to the seats just in front of the emergency seats near the wing as it was empty. I believe Indigo keeps these seats reserved as you can pay on board to upgrade these seats but no one bothered me for moving to these seats. Slept throughout the flight and overall flight was comfortable and very clean. No IFE or food but this was a short flight so not bothered at all about it would recommend in future.,yes
IndiGo,3,"""poor ground service""",Rakesh Dhareshwar,28th November 2015,"Poor ground service, they asked me to check in my hand baggage for excess weight, which I understand is the rule. But when I was boarding the aircraft, I was amazed to find that loads of passengers had huge hand bags and in some cases multiple bags, which possibly were more than the weight limit. The ground staff told me that they check the weight again at the boarding gate to ensure that there is no overweight baggage, but I did not see any other bag being weighed other than mine!",no

Booked well in advance under a deal and it is 100% worth every penny. From the ease of web check in to boarding, the IndiGo staff were very friendly. The journey was very comfortable, aircraft relatively new, flight stewardess were very friendly. Flight departure/arrival were on time. During the hop at Kolkata, we were even allowed to visit the cockpit and the captain demonstrated the functionalities. I never expected this kind of treatment, and we were very satisfied overall with Indigo. Even our return journey to Chennai was again with IndiGo, which again is very pleasing experience overall for us.",yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,Rishad Patell,3rd September 2015,"Mumbai to Jaipur via Delhi with Indigo. Check in at Mumbai for drop off (for web check in) is longer than the regular check in line. Efficient check in staff. These flights were all on time and the cabin crew efficient. Aircraft was clean, neat and well maintained. Still the best airline in India.",yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Aaditya Suratkar,3rd September 2015,"Quick check in, followed by efficient and punctual boarding. Buses in great condition. Newer aircrafts. Smiling and professional cabin crew. Captains update passengers regularly with clear announcements. Although it is a low cost carrier, a bit more cushioning on seats would be great. All in all, highly recommended, at least for Indian domestic sector.",yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Rajan Bulchand,3rd September 2015,"Speedy check in. Boarding as typical in Pune airport. Not very organised, but still went well. Plane was very clean. Crisp and new feeling. Crew was smiling. My first experience on this airline, and will stick to it when travelling inside India. It is a low Cost but for Low Costs it ticks all the Boxes.",yes
IndiGo,5,IndiGo customer review,Shrivallabh Randad,3rd September 2015,We have taken the flight from Indore and we are regular flyers with Indigo. The seats were most uncomfortable. There was hardly any cushioning on the seat. Experience of seat was more or less similar to as if we were seating on wooden bench. You have already curtailed seat pitch and now the un-cushioned seats. You are requested to have some feeling for passengers minimum level of actual comfort also. Looking forward for better and more comfortable seats.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,B Vincent,3rd September 2015,"I recently took several flights with IndiGo and didn't experience any major issues. I checked other airlines before I booked and IndiGo were consistently cheaper, often by a wide margin. Flights were all on time or within a few minutes of it, aircraft were spotlessly clean and even though the seat pitch is average for LCC at 29"", the seats are reasonably comfortable thanks to an intelligent slimline design - others could learn from this. Staff were friendly and professional throughout. In-flight food is purchase-only and expensive by Indian standards (although they will provide free drinking water) - a word of caution about pre-ordering, if you take up the 250Rs pre-paid option you could end up losing money, depending on your choice of food/drink. Also it appears they load up food and drink at the start of the day, and some options (e.g. Jaljeera juice) seem to consistently run out. But these are minor quibbles, I would have no hesitation choosing IndiGo next time.",yes
IndiGo,5,IndiGo customer review,Kalpesh Ashar,3rd September 2015,6E 062. Service has deteriorated. On-time urgency once seen is no longer seen. Online seat booking charges for all aisle and window seats. You can only get middle seats for free. Too money minded.,no
IndiGo,,IndiGo customer review,Pinaki Bhadury,3rd September 2015,"6E189 6th June. Low budget Airline - their fares are more or less the same if not more at times than full service carriers yet they continue to enjoy all the subsidies of a low budget airline. On time is a good thing - their flights are often now delayed or run late. Check-in process - everyone knows how long the queues are at the check in counters. Two days back on 4th June I did Web Check in for my 6th June flight using my smartphone. While I was successful in doing web check-in in spite of me giving the email address and phone no I did not get a copy of the boarding pass - beating the while process of doing Web check-in. At Delhi T1 terminal when I tried to print my boarding pass at the Check in Kiosk while it displayed the Boarding Pass I did not get my print out! On taking it up with the ground staff I got a casual reply - please stand in the queue even though I mentioned that the flight was due to board in next 35 minutes he simply refused to help me. As a result I reached the counter just 30 minutes before the departure of the flight and the check in lady commented ""Sir you are very late please be on time next time""! I have booked 3 tickets for my family through on-line booking system. After I had filled in all the passenger details I was asked whether I would like to take the pre-assigned seats facility and I declined and continued with my booking. But to my surprise and disappointment I found seats were allotted together that included an aisle and window seat along with the middle seat. When I tried to change the seats it did not allow me and charged me Rs 400 extra (Rs 200 each for Window and Aisle 'premium' seats) over and above the fare and there was no way I could change it.",no
IndiGo,3,IndiGo customer review,Roma Solomon,3rd September 2015,We were supposed to board our flight from Delhi to Lucknow at 12.15 on the 21st of May but there was confusion all around as the flight was late and the ground crew were not able to display any sign at the boarding gate or give us some explanation. Finally they herded us in a bus that was then parked in front of the plane on the tarmac for 20 minutes while the incoming passengers disembarked. Needless to say we were packed like sardines and it was extremely hot. Also there was no step - senior citizens like myself cannot climb easily. I have reported this before but it has made no difference. At Lucknow despite there being aerobridges we had to get down in the sun at 2:30 pm and were again herded into a bus. I was reluctant to board as the bus was very full but was forced to climb in. Is it a problem to use the bus a second time or the aerobridge or maybe nobody cares? It was the same story on the way back on the 22nd of May for the 6.40 flight. We were again stuffed into two buses and had to risk falling on somebody's luggage because the insensitive staff did not care. I will not travel on Indigo again unless they provide a step on the buses and do not herd us in like cattle.,no
IndiGo,5,IndiGo customer review,P Gould,3rd September 2015,Went from Delhi to Kochi because there is no such thing as a direct Delhi to Male (Maldives) flight and even with connections you have to mix and match airlines in order to get a halfway decent connection schedule. The airline is like the low budget carriers in Europe with people packed in like sardines. They don't have an inflight magazine that actually has anything to read or even a map with their air routes.,no
IndiGo,6,IndiGo customer review,Tan Ying Kuan,3rd September 2015,DEL-PNQ(Pune)-DEL. December 2014. Worst possible time of the year to fly out of Delhi. Had horrible experiences due to the fog. The outgoing flight was 4hrs late. You might think we were made to wait at the airport for this time but no we were boarded onto the aircraft bang on time and were made to wait there for over 4 hrs. That being said I agree this is no fault of the airline as the airport authorities force them to board the planes to decongest the terminal. Complimentary snack box and tea/coffee was provided. On the return flight( night time flight) we were diverted to Ahmedabad due to fog. This was totally acceptable but the events which followed made me doubt Indigo's reputation. We were not allocated a hotel for the next 5hrs. When we approached the assistants at Ahmedabad they kept telling us that a bus was being arranged. Finally at 3am they hired some taxis and took us to a decent hotel. No food or drinks was offered to us during the course of our wait and Ahmedabad airport is very poorly equipped with food stalls. We we're boarded onto a new flight the following day. Though diversions cannot be controlled by the airline the customer care can surely be looked into.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,M Herler,10th April 2015,Short haul from Delhi to Kathmandu. Clean on time friendly staff aircraft seemed new. Highly recommend Indigo for domestic flights in India or within Southeast Asia. Nothing special but low fares and definitely better service than Air India.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,B Dossin,10th April 2015,4 March 2015 Flight 6E178. 6 March 2015 Flight 6E665. I flew from Mumbai to Delhi back and forth and it was great. The seats were comfortable (I took the first row seat with more leg space) the crew were very pleasant and we arrived on time. On the way back I arrived 3 hours earlier in Delhi and they were kind enough to let me go on the next flight so I didn't have to wait at the airport. Overall my experience with Indigo was 5 stars!,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,S Friedman,10th April 2015,Chennai to Delhi in economy. Pretty short flight so it's hard to complain. Comfortable seats good service and we left and arrived right on time. We were 2kg over (in 2 bags) but staff let it pass. Would fly Indigo again.,yes
IndiGo,2,IndiGo customer review,Manoj Chaumal,10th April 2015,Was travelling from Dubai to Mumbai. I was fond of Indigo before this trip. Check-in was smooth and my hand baggage was less than 7 kgs so there was no excess luggage charge. However got some shopping from the Duty free. As far as I know and being travelled on other airlines for international trip. Shopping at Duty free is not considered as Hand baggage weight. Wait this is Indigo. You would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine. And charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at Duty free. What more the person carries only manual slip. No credit cards accepted not even USD or INR (Globally accepted currency / Home currency). Had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. This was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks (40 AED / Kg). Plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty. Asked the cabin crew if I can sit at emergency exit as have some extra leg space answer I got was that I would have to pay extra if I want to sit. They would rather keep the seat vacant then let some one sit. Very disappointed with the approach.,no
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Shyamala Seshan,10th April 2015,Jan 1-12 2015. Flight 6E 414 and 6E 461. BLR to Mumbai return. Being a senior citizen I had requested for travel assistance and was provided very promptly. The staff were very courteous and helpful. Here onwards I will prefer to fly Indigo Airlines and will recommend to others.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,P Ryan,10th April 2015,Mumbai - Thiruvananthapuram 25 Dec 2014 Flight SG215. A very good option for domestic flights in India. All flights we took were on-time. Efficient check-in at airports. Seats weren't that comfortable but for short haul flights you can't complain.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,M Riccardo,10th April 2015,Delhi to Mumbai on Dec 31st. I had a good experience flying Indigo. We left on time plane was new and clean and service was good. Only comment is that FAs should smile a little more but besides that I was quite impressed by the service and would definitely use them again.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,S Sankar,10th April 2015,MAA-BLR and BLR-BOM with a young family. Both flights were on time the aircraft were clean and the FAs very friendly and accommodating. Whilst we could not check in online with young children for some reason the check in staff ensured we were allotted the seats we requested. Staff were also flexible with us checking in most of our luggage (and exceeding the 15kg/person) instead of taking a carry on bag for each of the children making our lives easier. Bags were delivered even before we reached the belt in both cases. Streets ahead of Easyjet and Ryanair. The only domestic airline I ever book in India.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Purna Ananth,10th April 2015,6E 294 and 552 between BOM and BBI - Clean aircraft with decent leg space comfortable crew friendly and helpful good choice of food items for purchase on board. On time into BBI slightly delayed on return to BOM. Only negative was some luggage appeared on the belt very late at BOM due to a mix-up apparently. Overall up to the standards expected from Indigo.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Kumar Ganesh,10th April 2015,DEL-COK-DEL. Before time arrival on both the legs clean aircraft smiling hostess - what more can one ask for. By far India's best LCC.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Haresh Advani,1st December 2014,Flew from Poona to Calcutta and then a connection again IndiGo to Bangkok. Both flights virtually flawless. Have to always commend the cabin crew on their providing a comfortable flight. Noticed something new this time: on deplaning one of the cockpit staff emerges to join the cabin crew in bidding adieu. I do have a suggestion: the designers of the new Calcutta airport omitted to provide any kind of elevator/lift connection - to assist passengers with luggage - for those transferring from arrivals (ground floor) to departures (first floor). Maybe IndiGo can have a staff member on the ground floor to assist arriving IndiGo passengers transferring to departures and carrying heavy luggage?,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,Adam Miller,1st December 2014,Delhi to Kochi last Friday. Check in was efficient by friendly smartly dressed staff. My check in bag was over the 15kg limit. When I mentioned that my hand luggage was much lighter it was suggested I transfer between bags thus saving a hefty fee. Good clean aircraft but the pre-ordered meal was a disappointment. A packed fast food instant rice or noodle concoction possibly the type served to astronauts in deep space.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,S Shivadasani,1st December 2014,Flew IndiGo November 11 to Kolkota from Bangkok. A full flight. On time takeoff very friendly and accommodating staff seats are ok cabin and toilets clean. Been flying IndiGo on and off the past few years and this has been my usual experience. Never tried the food but the cabin staff at least on this flight constantly asked - even though I never ordered any food - if I needed water each time the food cart went past.,yes
IndiGo,4,IndiGo customer review,Arup Ghosh,1st December 2014,"Delhi (DEL) - Kolkata (CCU) 6 Nov 14 6E219 - Was traveling with a small trolley bag (15"" diagonally) and a compact laptop bag (15"" diagonally). Total weight 11 kgs. Got the shock of my life when they said that they wouldn't allow more than 7 Kgs in cabin including laptop. Now I had a laptop and charger. Then I had a SLR Camera with lenses plus a change of clothes and some files. They asked me to pack all the fragile items into one bag and check-in the other. Imagine my situation. There was no way I could fit all the fragile items into one bag and weigh in at less than 7 kgs. I checked-in the bag and nothing was damaged. On to other aspects of the flight. The seats are cramped and the seat back is very thin. You feel the knees of the guy behind you! The food they sell is mediocre. If you want on time performance then probably this LCC is the best in India. But if you want customer friendly service comfortable seats good food or in-flight entertainment (none exists on Indigo aircraft's) or for that matter a reasonable cabin baggage policy then do look elsewhere.",no
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Varun Ravichandran,1st December 2014,Chennai to Bangalore. The flight took off from Chennai on time with the captain warning us beforehand that there was very heavy weather over Bangalore that he would try to avoid. We eventually got to Bangalore airspace and ended up circling for 20 minutes or more until the captain announced that the thunderstorm had passed and we could land before our fuel situation worsened. Reasonably comfortable seat and friendly crew possibly the most efficient LCC in the Indian skies at the moment and wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.,yes
IndiGo,1,IndiGo customer review,Sriharsha Narasimhan,1st December 2014,Flight 6E 473 from Mumbai to Bangalore was delayed by 12 minutes at 22.02 HRS due to weather conditions en-route to Bangalore. However it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage - first bag was delivered at 22.42 hrs! Bangalore Airport is very efficient and I have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years - both domestic and international flights. This delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad co-ordination amongst the ground staff. Today IndiGo Airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive - they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes. No supervisory staff were available to address the issue. Rain had stopped when this flight landed. Since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight - walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus. None of us were wet - but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute! Indigo Flight 6E 412 from Kochi to Bangalore landed at 22.06 hrs even this flight was late. But the last bag for this Indigo flight was on belt at 22.24 hrs. If the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the Mumbai-Bangalore flight how can they blame the weather system! I don't see any reason other than staff inefficiency and bad co-ordination for this delay.,no
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Singh Ashutosh,1st December 2014,Flew from Goa - Delhi on 11 Aug 2014 Flight on time. Nice and clean aircraft. Wide range of snacks available for purchase though rates were exorbitant. The only negative point would be air hostesses being less interactive and involved.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,J Knibbe,1st December 2014,Flew from Delhi to Coimbatore and then from Chennai to Kolkata. This is an outstanding low-cost airline. I couldn't really find any fault with them! All staff were very friendly professional and helpful the planes were modern and spotless the captain gave informative and friendly announcements before during and after the flight the food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced; and the inflight magazine was well-produced. In Delhi we got stuck in a traffic jam caused by a sudden storm and so we only arrived at the aiport about 10 minutes before the flight. We assumed that we would miss the flight and have to make a plan B but the excellent and helpful staff quickly issued us boarding passes and rushed us to the plane so we still got away on time.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,Narendra Gajala,1st December 2014,I quite often travel from Pune to Nagpur and I would always prefer Indigo over other budget airlines. The ground staff and flight crew is humble and helpful and they give you good attention when needed. Flight crew seems well trained and organized compared to crew of other airlines. In-flight food options are good and inexpensive. They serve coffee unlike GoAir. Ticket pricing is better than competition.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Tanmay Bhakta,1st December 2014,I flew with them from Bangalore to Pune recently. Ground staff at Bangalore airport were a bit disorganized but managed to get us on board fast. Seat was fairly ok but if you are a large person you will feel very uncomfortable as the armrests on this airline did not go up. After take off we were offered drinks despite Indigo being a budget airline. I felt a little hungry halfway through the flight and I manger to get a packet of chips for a cheap price. After which we landed in Pune fresh and nourished. Overall Indigo I feel has service that is better than any other budget airline that I knew.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,M Fewster,22nd July 2014,Flew Chennai Jaipur and return. Efficient service good value and organization from a cut price carrier. New clean aircraft friendly staff. Only problem was that out first booking had not actually been confirmed despite us having a booking number. I received nothing from Indigo to tell me this and I missed the small print on my booking. With an 30 minutes to spare a very helpful groundstaff person went to a lot of trouble to get us new bookings and got us the last seats on our flight. Brickbats for not providing better info re the not confirmed booking (we still don't know why) but kudos to the staff member who helped us in Chennai airport.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Patell Rishad,22nd July 2014,Flew BOM to Goa return and BOM to Delhi. The Goa flights were rescheduled many times and we got constant updates by SMS many weeks in advance. Check in at Bombay was smooth with the web check in counter being empty. Flights on time and service was good.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Prithvi Ramesh,22nd July 2014,Flew MAA-AMD on Indigo 6e-237. Check in went smoothly the flight was on time it was clean and appeared new and had ample legroom. The food was delicious. The flight crew were quick and efficient. Overall good experience and no problems. Would fly Indigo again.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Rahul Kumar,22nd July 2014,Flew Delhi-Chennai-Coimbatore in December with family. Check-in was swift and they even allowed little more luggage for our family. I had pre-booked meals and front seats. Non Veg food is served at room temperature which should be provided hot. Staff were friendly and flight was comfortable. I will definitely fly Indigo again.,yes
IndiGo,,IndiGo customer review,Devayani Hirani,22nd July 2014,Kept waiting for more then one hour in the plane to pick up some late comers. I am a frequent traveller from abroad and was on Goa - Ahmedabad flight on 27th February. It was 3.25pm but took off after 4.30. The onboard crew or flight deck crew were not bothered about other passengers. The passengers we waited for had booked 150 seats. I was sitting right in the front seat in row 1 so could hear what was said. There was no apology from the crew or cabin staff. When we landed at Ahmedabad airport we reported to the ground staff. We were asked to complain to the customer service knowing there will be no outcome. It was first time I had travelled Indigo who boast of their punctuality. Never again.,no
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,Marek Wrobel,22nd July 2014,Last week I flew from BOM to Goa and return. Both flights were slightly delayed (ca 15 mins) but the quality of the service has compensated for these minor delays. The planes are new offering ample legroom - on the flight back we were offered emergency exit seats with no extra fee- which was really nice of them. This flight is really short- ca 37 mins from take-off to touch-down so not much time to offer paid (or pre-paid) meals. In general comparing to European 'no frills' airlines IndiGo presents generally a better offering and service.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,M Satish,22nd July 2014,Chennai - Mumbai and back. On time departure clean aircraft efficient cabin crew and on-time arrival. No wonder that they are the most preferred airline for domestic travel within India.,yes
IndiGo,1,IndiGo customer review,P Kale,22nd July 2014,I recently travelled on an Indigo flight from Delhi to Mumbai. My printed ticket stated that I was allowed to carry one checked in bag of 15 Kgs one cabin bag of 7 Kgs and in addition a laptop bag. However during check in I was asked to weigh all three pieces (suitcase cabin bag and laptop) and was told that the cabin baggage allowance was only a total of 7 Kgs which includes laptop bag shopping bags and cabin bag. So please note that if you decide to travel with Indigo airlines you are only allowed one suitcase of 15Kgs and all your cabin bags (laptop shopping bags and cabin bag) should not exceed 7 Kgs. Moreover what is printed on the ticket makes no difference to them.,no
IndiGo,3,IndiGo customer review,R Manohar,22nd July 2014,Flight 6E 284 from Chennai to Delhi on 6th Feb 2014. I took the morning flight at 8.20 am this meant that I did not have my breakfast before the flight. The flight duration to Delhi is 150 minutes. I wanted to have my breakfast on the flight I was waiting with my purse in my hand. The air hostesses were slow and inefficient to say the least. They just walked past me and did not ask if wanted anything. They simply pushed the trolley past and went and sat down. I gave up and sat extremely hungry and frustrated.,no
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Chadha Jitender,22nd July 2014,Flew Delhi-Chennai-Coimbatore in December with family. Check-in was swift and they even allowed little more luggage for our family. I had pre-booked meals and front seats. Non Veg food is served at room temperature which should be provided hot. Staff were friendly and flight was comfortable. I will definitely fly Indigo again.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,S Srinivasan,13th January 2014,"MAA-DEL. It's been a few years since I've flown Indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good - easy check-in procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally on-time clean planes and all for a good price. I decided to try the ""Fast Forward"" service which provides priority check-in and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person. While the services were delivered as promised I found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular check-in line was very short and baggage delivery in DEL is fast even without the priority tags. The seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep. I don't think I'd want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes. Also they appear to have recently dropped their domestic baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg per passenger. Excess baggage fees are reasonable if prepaid online but be aware of this especially if you are connecting to an onward international flight.",yes
IndiGo,3,IndiGo customer review,Patel Beena,13th January 2014,I flew from Pune to Bangalore on 30th December 2013 on Flt 6E 407. I bought a chicken sandwich for my son and it was awful! I usually fly Indigo Airline because of it's assurance of timely arrivals and departures. I've never had a reason to complain until my last experience. The flight was delayed. But the worst part was that the on board staff was inattentive and didn't even attempt to sell any meals on board. They just served passengers who had pre-booked their meals. When I asked for the chicken sandwich the flight attendant stared at me like I'd asked her to bring me an elephant from the zoo. This is the first time I've been on the receiving end of aloof treatment from Indigo staff.,no
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Purna Ananth,13th January 2014,6E 427 BOM-MAA and 6E 278 MAA-BOM. Airplanes were clean boarded on time arrived on time (may be even a shade early) crew were friendly and helpful. Food items requested were available and tasty. Only negative is that service on board was slow leaving no time for inflight sales.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,A Kashyap,13th January 2014,Nov 4 2013. Route: HYD-BLR. I have been a frequent flyer on Indigo over the years and the airline has never failed to deliver. As noted by others here spotless aircraft helpful crew members and on-time service are what set it apart. I recommend the airline to all my friends visiting India from abroad. I'm flying Indigo's international service for the first time next year and am looking forward to the same level of service.,yes
IndiGo,5,IndiGo customer review,J Sastry,13th January 2014,Pune to Delhi. I had booked my meals under Corporate Plan. I was served food only 15 minutes before the flight was to Land i.e 1.5 hrs after the flight took off. The service started late and then the crew were serving/selling in each row going back to front rows serving water discussing menu options with those buying and chatting amongst themselves. On other airlines food is first served to those who pre-book. After selling to all they don't have many items left for serving. Suggest they keep the standard menu and serve pre booked passengers first.,no
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,I Lancaster,13th January 2014,"DEL-TRV Nov 11. My first Indigo flight. As budget airlines go excellent! Actually strike ""budget""! You get what you pay for and you know what you're paying for and Indigo delivered to a T and with aplomb. New clean airy decor aircraft lovely FAs. And a lovely touch that others could copy: no jetway but instead of steps up they have a ramp so it's easy to get rollers up to the plane. Spent half an hour on the ground at Cochi during which the cabin was well-cleaned (lavatories included) and properly vacuumed. Compare that to Ryanair!",yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Debaditya Haldar,13th January 2014,I booked my tickets through Indigo to travel to my hometown in Kolkata during Diwali. I am impressed with the services provided by Indigo. A320's were clean and spotless with great sitting arrangements and ample leg space.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,M Jasuja,13th January 2014,Delhi-Bangkok-Delhi. New A320 aircraft's were clean. Since it is a budget airline they are very particular about checked in baggage and charge for every extra kilo. Even some passengers were nasty the flight attendants were friendly. I took my meal from airport so it was better and cheaper than on board. The flights were on time. I would fly IndiGo again!,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,A Swamy,13th January 2014,BLR-BOM return. On time departure arrival before scheduled time for both flights. Smooth check-in process and assignment of seats. Clean and spotless aircraft's legroom a bit limited though. Cabin crew very efficient and lot of smiles. Masala tea bought on board was tasty. Bus rides between gates and aircraft. On return leg we were transiting from SIN (different airline) and had excess baggage. They just checked the boarding passes for the international leg and did not charge anything extra as baggage fees!,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Prithvi Ramesh,13th January 2014,Flew from MAA to PNQ on 4th October. Check went on smooth. The flight was on time. The sandwich served onboard was excellent. Very clean and new aircraft. The flight arrived ahead of scheduled time. Overall wonderful experience. I would definitely fly with them again.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,S Naida,7th October 2013,If you are looking to enjoy a comfortable flight then look no further than Indigo. I am quite fussy about my travelling because of which I have completely put my faith in Indigo Airlines. I love the fact that the flights are punctual and the passengers are not made to wait. The flight attendants welcome you with a warm smile and make you feel comfortable. The flights are well maintained and the washrooms are also hygienic. The crew and the management have certainly done a wonderful job in keeping their patrons happy and satisfied. There was plenty of legroom available on-board even though my flight was full. If you are planning to travel with elderly people then do not worry. The staff are extremely friendly. This airline has always been my preference over others. I will strongly recommend their services.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,Ranjeet Bhardwaj,7th October 2013,My job requires plenty of flying and I am a frequent user of Indigo. Everything is up to the mark the only thing that bothers me is the legroom I will say that it is really not comfortable. Flying again in November with Indigo.,yes
IndiGo,7,IndiGo customer review,D Gujrathi,7th October 2013,I flew from Pune to Chennai economy class 12.00 noon flight. Friendly staff but bad food and very poor leg space compared to other airlines. Clean toilets staff are helpful and friendly. Will definitely fly with Indigo again.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Giridhar Penumarti,7th October 2013,DXB-DEL-DXB and was returning with my grandmother who was a wheelchair passenger. DXB-DEL the flight was half full and that allowed a lot of space to stretch out and sleep in comfort and while the outgoing service was excellent the return journey was par excellence. From the moment we arrived at T3 Delhi IGI our every need was met and every question answered with professionalism and friendliness. The ground handling staff member was very friendly and knowledgeable the check in staff at Delhi were very friendly and helpful and the crew of 6E21 provided service that cannot be faulted. I would have no hesitation in travelling with Indigo Airlines again.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,S Menon,7th October 2013,Afternoon departure from Chennai to Mumbai. Flight delayed but informed well in advance. Easy Check in. The aircraft was spotlessly clean. They managed to turnaround the aircraft in 20 minutes. Saw passengers disembarking from the previous flight at the same time when we were bussed to the aircraft which I thought was quite amazing. The cabin crew were very professional and took time to individually ask passengers on the feedback about the flight and quality of service. Will fly them again.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Daniel Johnson,7th October 2013,Flew Indigo from Delhi to Bangalore and return. I have used Indigo several times over the years and the years and they have yet to disappoint me. I was particularly amazed at the great customer service and the cabin crew's happy attitude towards the customers. On-ground check in was fast and easy. Transfer from T3 (international terminal) at Delhi to the domestic terminal was a breeze this time around. Super clean planes. Will strongly recommend for travel for domestic flying in India.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,S Karthekeyaan,7th October 2013,I flew from Delhi to Chennai. Good legroom space and good service by the cabin crew. The flight arrived early.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Rishad Patell,7th October 2013,Indigo from Mumbai to Goa and return. Flights were packed on both legs. We got emergency exit seats both ways as we asked for them. Great leg room and worth it for the 1 hour flight. Both flights on time. Service good. Planes are clean and they look new unlike many ageing Indian carriers. Value for money.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,A Krummacher,7th October 2013,I use Indigo regularly to fly BKK-DEL. Great airline with great fares! Easy to navigate website with no hidden costs. Never had any delays actual departure in many cases before the scheduled departure time. Extremely friendly and cheerful crew. Only complaint the rather expensive food and drink onboard and not accepting Indian currency on international flights.,yes
IndiGo,,IndiGo customer review,Bansal Shailesh,7th October 2013,26 May 2013 Jaipur to Chennai. I saw some dirty used cups and wet tissues in the seat pocket in front of me. I highlighted this immediately to the cabin crew whilst boarding was going on. Told it would be cleaned in the next clearance and nothing could be done at that time. I was shocked and surprised with this answer. The cleaning was done in Ahmedabad by ground staff and then the flight took off for my destination Chennai. On time performance took higher importance over cleanliness and hygiene. The attitude of cabin crew was horrible. I will never fly Indigo again.,no
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,N Sundera,23rd May 2013,"Goa to Bombay. Flight delayed an hour ""due to runway issues"" in Goa. Ground staff very helpful and accommodating and blocked out 2 adjacent seats for us at the front of the aircraft. Aircraft (A320) was clean crew were efficient although a little harried with the buy-on-board meal service given the short flight time. Good value for money and would fly them again.",yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Kumar Ganesh,23rd May 2013,DEL-BLR-DEL. Both legs had a before time push back reached destination 10-15 mins early. Quick professional check-in. Had pre-ordered meals good value for money. Only problem with this airline is that you cannot just pre- book seats meals have to be booked with it otherwise highly recommended.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,S Menon,23rd May 2013,Early morning departure from Chennai to Delhi. Boarding process completed before time and on time push back. Clean aircraft with an efficient cabin crew. Landed on time in Delhi. One of the best airlines to fly in India.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,N Sasilatha,23rd May 2013,New Delhi to Thiruvananthapuram via Kochi. Only Indigo has a direct flight in this sector at the time of writing. The flight experience was very good. Fare was cheap as booked early online selected the meal plus seating combination- Indigo Plus. Check-in and boarding was efficient flight departed and reached destination on time as per schedule. Though selected a standard seat on row 3the legroom was very comfortable. The aircraft was new and interior was clean. The only bad thing was the pre booked food booked online wasn't up to expected quality. Not sure whether its because we ordered vegetarian meal.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,Karl Moosbrugger,23rd May 2013,Used Indigo BOM-TRV for the first time main reason was no other suitable alternative available. The aircraft was spotless looked brand new and the crew attentive and very polite. Legroom is very limited but I knew that before so I can't complain and for a 2 hour flight I could survive it. Tasty snacks were sold at reasonable prices on board. Flight was on time.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Sidath Baranage,23rd May 2013,I flew with Indigo in August 2012. Given the hype about this airline I thought of giving them a try and they didn't disappoint. Website was easy to use. However I wish they'd allow pre-booking of seats at least for a nominal fee. You have to buy 'Indigo Plus' which is meals + seat so if you don't want a meal there will be no seat selection. Aircraft was an A320 and it was in excellent condition. Cabin crew was polite and friendly. Food is available for sale and water is provided in cups free of charge. However there isn't much space between the seats and does feel a little cramped.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Alan Lacey,23rd May 2013,MAA-TRV and TRV-BOM. Easy to use website for online booking and immediate text confirmation to my mobile. Fast courteous check in . New aircraft comfortable seats and departures ahead of schedule. FAs were all smart friendly and attentive. Great fare and an extra 600 rupees (about £7.50) got me a reserved extra legroom seat food and drink. Food was fresh excellent quality and well presented. Everything about this airline was slick and professional with an element of fun. A great experience and highly recommended.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,S Menon,23rd May 2013,Morning Departure from Mumbai. There was a snaking queue at check -in but the staff were very prompt and I got my boarding pass in 10 mins. Clean aircraft and push back 5 mins ahead of schedule. Landed in Chennai 15 minutes ahead of scheduled time. Good value for money.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,U V Naresh,23rd May 2013,I was supposed to fly from Delhi to Mumbai this morning (10.25am) on Indigo but Delhi airport was heavily fogged out and the runway operations had been shut for a few hours. I was not informed of any impending cancellations or delays and proceeded to the airport a normal. Upon arrival I was very politely informed that no departures had taken place this day and Indigo were unsure when departures would take place. They immediately asked me if I would like to take the first available flight on the day but because of the fog and my return on the same evening I declined and requested them if they could delay and reschedule this by a few days later which they happily and professionally did at no extra cost or dreaded penalties. The whole affair was so well handled I was most impressed by Indigo's ground staff. This is one rare gem in the Indian aviation scene.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Tasneem Yousuff,23rd May 2013,For the first time my husband and I travelled with Indigo airlines 2 days ago and were very sceptical as it was a budget airline and we had slightly excess baggage. To our surprise from our very first contact with the Indigo airline staff to the end of our trip we were impressed. The lovely young lady at Mumbai airport greeted us with pleasantries checked in our luggage which was a bit above the limit. Once on board on our flight to Singapore we found the seats spacious and comfortable the crew courteous and professional. The inflight service was excellent and reasonably priced. We purchased some spiced chai and cookies that came beautifully packaged in a tin. Regular announcements by the crew were clear and polite. Would gladly travel Indigo Airlines again and highly recommend it.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,W Montego,8th January 2013,Flew MAA-PNQ (Chennai-Pune). Excellent crew and food service. Seats were terrible and the plane was unclean. One thing I respect about IndiGo is their promptness. The problem with that was that as soon as all passengers had disembarked the next group boarded. Nevertheless the best domestic duty-free I've ever seen.,yes
IndiGo,,IndiGo customer review,Kapil Khandelwal,8th January 2013,I travelled from Bangalore to Jaipur. The leg space between seats was the length of my iPad. If the seat in front is reclined it would hit you face. Very uncomfortable amongst the low cost carriers. Looks like the airline is interested in making money by cramming more seats.,no
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Rishad Patell,8th January 2013,BOM-DEL-BOM. Early morning departure from Bombay was on time and a good flight. Very full both ways. Good check in services and very courteous staff. Good airline to fly domestic.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,V Bagaria,8th January 2013,Flew Kolkata-Bangalore via Chennai. Flight departed on time the aircraft despite being one of their older ones was clean and well-maintained. The crew were simply superb. Though the catering onboard should improve. The variety is very restricted. We made an early arrival at Bangalore despite a late arrival in Chennai. Will fly them again.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,V Agarwal,8th January 2013,"COK-BOM. Check in at Cochin a breeze no queue at all. A320 was clean and modern. The flight attendants were active and friendly. on and arrived on time. In Mumbai the bags were out in ten minutes.

The sandwiches to purchase in a box that said ""airwich"" even the cashew nuts came in a collectable tin which said ""Nut Case"" on it.",yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Ameya Chitre,8th January 2013,BOM-BDQ on A320. Check-in was not as efficient as I have know Indigo to have. But it was not a problem.

IndiGo,7,IndiGo customer review,Saketh Rahm,8th January 2013,Overall a good experience from HYD-BLR-HYD and HYD-DEL. Planes are new and modern crew all young pleasant and helpful and speak perfect English. Seating is very tight - the person in from of me reclined their seat and it was in my face. They sell food which is tasty and well priced. One major negative as at check in at HYD. My company bought my ticket in the US and they asked me to produce the credit card. As I could not they denied me boarding until I bought another ticket which was very frustrating and almost caused me to miss the flight. They gave me an email print out for a refund but this is certainly not up to international standards.,yes

The crew was unprofessional, unhelpful, and lacked basic courtesy. Lack of information regarding flight delays, boarding, and other essential updates. No assistance provided for damaged seats or basic amenities. Charged ₹2400 for being 1 minute late for boarding, despite a long queue. This policy seems unfair and exploitative. Seats were damaged and uncomfortable. Long queues and inefficient boarding process.  Overall, a poorly managed and chaotic experience.  Avoid flying with SpiceJet unless absolutely necessary.",no

There was no apology from the airline or even offer for some water and snacks.

The customer service only sends automated emails. Whoever you email to, the response is an immediate auto response email.

SpiceJet,1,“Worst ever domestic airline”,Kamal Dhama,23rd September 2024,✅ Trip Verified | Worst ever domestic airline in India currently. Their flights are always delayed for 3-4 hours and their support staff always comes with strange and poor reasons. They don’t care about their passengers. They make them wait for long hours without providing them the actual timings. They don’t even compensate for their delays. They offer a refund if a flight is delayed by 3 hours which is useless anyways because you have to book another flight for you on the spot which costs you double the amount and you are already late. Their support staff is not even bothered to help and guide their passengers. Inside the flight you won’t even get a 250ml water bottle. If you request then only you will be given half of glass water only.,no

They lost our suitcases on a one-hour flight (they didn't directly put them on the plane) in addition to leaving with a delay of more than 3 hours, one of which they had us sitting on the plane without air conditioning (it was more than 30 degrees ) The suitcases were never sent to our next destination. We had to change plans and go to Delhi to look for them. They promised us they would send them and they didn't, they hung up on us, they didn't answer emails and most of the contact numbers don't work. More than 5 days without clothes, charger, medicine... and today it is impossible for us to claim anything, they tell us that they are not responsible. Several days wasted on calls and half an afternoon at the airport trying to claim and we left without getting anything. Jamás viajes con esta compañía. Nos perdieron las maletas en un vuelo de una hora (directamente no las subieron al avión) además de salir con un retraso de más de 3 horas, una de las cuales nos tuvieron sentados en el avión sin aire acondicionado (estábamos a más de 30 grados) Las maletas jamás nos las mandaron a nuestro siguiente destino. Tuvimos que cambiar planes e ir a Delhi a buscarlas. Nos prometían que las mandaban y no lo hacían, nos colgaban el teléfono, no contestaban a los emails y la mayoría de los números de contacto no funcionan. Más de 5 días sin ropa, cargador, medicinas...y a día de hoy nos es imposible reclamar nada, nos dicen que no se responsabilizan.

But the Pilot & the crew kept very calm & composed and Pilot also sounded very confident assuring us with his regular announcements although being a frequent flyer I knew this was very unusual weather disturbance.

If you communicate that you haven’t checked in any bag then they also do not listen. They are also not allowing you to shift the bag to check in baggage by saying that time is over.

The staff refused to let me board without paying Rs. 1,800/- for extra weight. I tried to convince saying I dont have a check in luggage. Please understand that it is a trap. They know very well that we cannot go and check in our luggage even if we want to because boarding has already started and it is less than an hour of departure. This is done intentionally to fleece the regular travellers who do not bother to check in a briefcase. Finally I had to pay 1,800/- or I had to miss the flight.",no

SpiceJet,1,"""Spicejet was bad""",R Varson,22nd June 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   Everyone knows the reputation spicejet has. I chose to ignore it and had booked a round trip with spicejet Hyderabad - Chennai. On my flight to Chennai, I had a terrible experience. The flight was already delayed by an hour. I did not have a checkin bag, and only had cabin. I was asked to pay 1800rs extra for my laptop bag. I've never faced this with any other airline. They waited for the flight checkin to close to start checking the bags. I was forced to pay the full amount, but they gave a discount for the passenger who came after me. The flying experience was not good, a bathroom door that kept making noise in the air - it was loose I guess. It's really surprising that spicejet is still operating. Coming to my return flight (at 8:45am), I was hoping it would be smooth. But again, just at the time of checking in my baggage (7:35am), I get message that the flight has been rescheduled to 12noon. Upon checking with the staff they said the flight was supposed to come from Ahmedabad to Chennai, before going to Hyderabad, but due to technical reasons got sent back mid way. Even the 12noon was just an estimate and it can get delayed further. There was no other airline having a flight earlier than that too. And obviously now with higher prices since it's last minute. But anyways I took this as a punishment for booking Spicejet. Took a full refund (which is pennies compared to the fare of my new booking and the cab from and to the airport again) and booked with a different airline. I chose to ignore the other reviews, I hope you don't. Spicejet was bad, is bad and will be bad.",no

Despite reporting the issue immediately upon arrival, I was disappointed with the lack of action taken by the airline to address the situation. Upon landing, I promptly notified SpiceJet staff about the missing luggage, providing all necessary details. However, I was dismayed by the lack of communication and follow-up from the airline regarding the status of my luggage. As a customer, I understand that unforeseen circumstances can occur, but it's essential for airlines to prioritize customer service and take proactive steps to resolve such issues. Unfortunately, my experience with SpiceJet fell short in this regard. I urge SpiceJet to improve its baggage handling procedures and enhance communication with passengers regarding luggage issues. It's crucial for airlines to demonstrate accountability and provide timely updates to affected customers. I hope that by sharing my experience, SpiceJet will take necessary steps to address the underlying issues and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.",no

SpiceJet,1,“they refused to take responsibility”,S Chatterjee,11th March 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | SpiceJet proved to be incredibly disappointing and untrustworthy in my recent experience. Traveling with my family, a total of six individuals, we embarked on a journey from Amritsar (ATQ), India to DXB (Dubai) on February 24, 2024. The scheduled departure time was 08:40 AM, with a connecting flight from Dubai to London Heathrow at 14:30 Hrs via Emirates. Our ticket was booked through the booking.com portal as a single ticket, rather than separate bookings to facilitate the connection. However, our experience with SpiceJet quickly turned sour. Departing from ATQ, the flight was delayed by 55 minutes. Upon arrival in Dubai, we encountered further frustration as we remained onboard the aircraft for over an hour and a half without disembarkation. Initially, we were given excuses regarding weather conditions, despite the clear and sunny day in Dubai, and optimal weather conditions for take-off. Eventually, a member of the ground staff revealed the truth - the delay was due to SpiceJet's scheduling issues and the busy nature of Dubai airport. This delay resulted in us missing our connecting flight to London Heathrow. Expecting assistance from SpiceJet, we hurried to their counter hoping for a resolution. However, to our dismay, they refused to take responsibility or provide any alternative solutions. Their staff was unhelpful and dismissive, leaving us stranded in Dubai with our children. Consequently, we were forced to purchase new tickets at a staggering cost of £4061 to secure our journey back to the UK. I feel compelled to caution others against falling victim to this airline's deceptive practices.

Come a week before the flight SpiceJet starts smsing and emailing us that there is no direct flight and we will need to choose an alternative flight with a connection in Delhi and 10 hour layover options. At such a last minute all airfares were exorbitant and it was impossible to rebook flights even if we took refund. We wrote to them asking for a hotel stay for the layover. This was denied too. They held on to our money for 6 months before doing this. This is not where the ordeal ends. The first flight was delayed. Sat on the runway for over an hour before take off. We had to rush and change terminals. We were assured that our suitcases would reach Jaisalmer with us by every flight attendant and their airport staff. They did not. We were stranded without our winter wear and suitcases for 2 days in Jaisalmer till our suitcases were given to us the next day. We were forced to spend thousands of rupees on new clothes for the entire family. We asked them to reimburse this amount too. They did not. We asked for our choice of sandwich as per their menu.

Despite daily calls to their customer service, there has been zero progress. The only consistent thing I've received from SpiceJet is false promises that I will get the revert on mail within 6 hours. It's been a month, and I'm still waiting for a revert mail. This lack of responsiveness and accountability is unacceptable.

Unfortunately, the flight experienced multiple delays: first pushed to 8 am, then further delayed to 10:50 am, 11 am, and finally 12:15 pm. These continuous delays were quite challenging for us, significantly disrupting our schedule. The airline's inefficiency led to a waste of our precious time. When we requested lounge access due to the prolonged delay, the airline offered a meal instead. There were murmurs among passengers about SpiceJet's limited staffing and flights, suggesting that they might be playing games with travelers.

The flight has been delayed without any proper communication for more than 4 times and it seems this is not the first time this Spicejet route is delayed. If they know that there is a discrepancy n regulatory requirement for flights to have an one-hour maintenance after an international trip, the spicejet team should have an alternate carrier or avoid this route. They keep delaying the flights often.",no

To begin with, their website loads incredibly slowly due to its terrible user experience. Despite everyone's criticism, I made my first-ever flight reservation due to some time constraints, and guess what? They were entirely correct. My flight, which was scheduled to depart at 10:20 pm, was originally changed to 1:55 am, extended to 4:10 am, and then delayed again to 4:40am while I was at the airport. Being a professional with a demanding schedule, I trusted and reserved this flight to have surgery the next morning. Please consider other airlines before making a commitment with Spicejet.

The time of delay is never communicated. The duration of delay can ever extend. And the biggest issue is that they won't ever approach or be available to address the concerns of the passengers. The response to why the delay happened will be so technical that you will wish to not have asked for it. The staff is rude and arrogant. In short, avoid this at all costs unless you have nothing to do on the day you wish to fly and are okay to spend time walking around the airport or spend time shopping at the airport.",no

Later the flight got delayed by 3 hours and 30 mins without any proper notice, to my surprise while checking upon the same with the airlines ground staff they were completely clueless of why this flight is getting delayed.

After that on arrival we were informed that even our luggage hasn't been transported and will be delivered the next day. 5am in the morning we were asked to fill forms for the same.

Customer care executive picked up after calling for the 10th time and waiting for almost 20 mins on the line. The resolution offered? She said don't get on the Bagdogra flight. Contact staff at the airport. Wouldn't have called if that had helped. Extremely unprofessional in sticking to the planned take off time. And my complaints were treated like a bother and received half hearted efforts from staff at every level.

SpiceJet,7,“a pretty good flight”,V Gupta,1st November 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | On my return to Mumbai from Kolkata, the airline auto-assigned me a random seat as I had selected that option during the web check-in. The baggage drop process at CCU airport was smooth and boarding also started on time. This time I was pleased to notice that the crew members were actually greeting all the passengers which was much better compared to the last time I had flown them. Departure was smooth and as this was an overnight flight the cabin lights were dimmed for most of the flight. Descent and landing were on time followed by a swift luggage retrieval. Overall for the price that was paid this was a pretty good flight.

SpiceJet has  a weighing machine at the entrance to check the weight of each passenger's hand luggage and they enforce a strict 7 kg limit. If you exceed this limit, you are charged a70 AED per kg. This situation is unacceptable and amounts to nothing less than exploitation of passengers who choose SpiceJet for budget-friendly fares. To add to the disappointment, the condition of the aircraft itself was far from satisfactory. The seats looked worn out, and the cabin appearance was lackluster. I urge fellow travelers to exercise caution when considering SpiceJet for your flights.",no

SpiceJet,5,"""a decent functional experience""",S Harshun,1st November 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  
I had taken this evening flight to Calcutta, during the web check-in, I had opted for the random seat selection for which there would be no charges applied as I was travelling solo, so before 12 hours of the departure, I had received the seat. Check-in was done at the old T1 terminal at BOM where baggage drop was done swiftly as there was no line and queues which was surprising. The boarding started on time however I noticed that when I was about to greet the crew there were 2 crew members who were not really greeting any of the passengers and seem surprised that I wished them good evening when they reciprocated. Ideally greeting the passengers is something that should be standard. Also I noticed that the load on this flight was on the lighter side as well however due to the ATC clearances the actual pushback and departure was delayed by over 1 hour but this was not on the airline. The pilots did a good job of keeping the passengers updated about the reasons for the delay. The flight itself was operated on one of those Boeing 737-800NG aircraft that was painted in the erstwhile JetConnect liveries. The pilots tried to make the time en route on the flight and was able to retrieve my luggage soon without waiting too long. While Spicejet has been going through a lot of difficulties in recent times, and that was also reflected in the manner in which the crew seemed disinterested in greeting the passengers, there are still small things that the airline can do which can still make a small difference to the passenger experience because otherwise for the fare that was paid this was a decent functional experience that was able to get me safely to my destination.",yes

SpiceJet,1,"""I was denied boarding""",Rohit Chaturvedi,1st November 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently booked a ticket from Chennai to Delhi on 6th September 2023. But, sadly I had to encounter the worst experience with Spicejet, where I was denied boarding on a mere request of writing only 2 words on the excess baggage receipt - ""Laptop Bag"" after payment of the excess baggage charges for the laptop bag that I was carrying. Such conduct from Spicejet was very unprofessional and dissatisfactory. When a customer pays the ticket price, he owns the right to travel through the flight and taking away this right is illegal in all terms. I cannot understand if there is a policy of spicejet to charge amounts for a laptop bag, what made the team cancel my onboarding on the request of adding these 2 words - ""Laptop Bag"" on the excess baggage charge payment receipt. To my utmost surprise, when I raised this with Spicejet, they are saying that I have only refused to travel and they did not deny onboarding. This is completely false, as any sensible person can vouch for it - if I would have to refuse travel I would not have even paid the excess baggage charges in the first instance. This is a pure betrayal from spicejet. At least, they should have the guts to accept what they did. They have even refused to refund the ticket price.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""A very bad experience""",Mahek Sharma,21st September 2023,"Not Verified |  A very bad experience. The boarding was early but the take off, the landing, everything else was late.

We were supposed to land at 7:20 but we landed at 8. The luggage did not arrive till 9 even though the landing was at 8 we had to wait an hour for the luggage and the manager who was standing there also had 0 communication of where our luggage was.

My recent journey with SpiceJet from Calicut to Dubai was a complete disappointment. The check-in process was marred by unprofessional behavior from the staff. We encountered an unfortunate experience with the staff, who displayed aggression and utter disrespect towards passengers. Adding to the distress, the staff demanded an exorbitant additional charge for our luggage, including an unreasonable claim for my baby's stroller, which we had previously taken on the same route without any problems during our outbound flight. This inconsistency and unjustified charge left us deeply dissatisfied. Despite providing proof of double payment, SpiceJet is yet to refund the excessive amount they charged us under duress. It is disheartening to see an airline of this stature failing to provide basic customer satisfaction. I sincerely hope Spice Jet takes immediate action and thoroughly trains their staff to treat passengers with respect and empathy. As loyal customers, we expect a better travel experience and fair treatment. This incident has left me questioning whether I should ever consider flying with SpiceJet again.",no

Now 2 days back I received an SMS from SpiceJet that the flight has been cancelled and there is no alternative flight available. I spoke to SpiceJet agent and requested them to arrange a flight for me on another carrier which is Indigo on which I was told that I need to write to higher authorities. This is plainly making a fool out of the customer as now the only direct flight which is available is Indigo and is more than double the price I paid for SpiceJet flight booked in advance.

With that the gate number changed for 44 to 76, travelling with aged people it is so difficult to change gates. When given a certain time for a flight going abroad, the airline is supposed to take care on everything the passengers have planned. Other than a bit of food compensation the SpiceJet staff has not been helpful what do ever. They aren’t even admitting their mistake and saying the flight is delayed they are telling all the passengers that the system is wrong we have the right information.

SpiceJet,5,"""the service was what was expected""",Ashish Varun,25th March 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I had booked this flight a month before flying as it came at a very cheap and reasonable rate. The web check in for the flight was fine and I had opted for the auto seat selection without getting charged a fare for seat selection. So the boarding pass was given to me 12 hours before departure. The check in and baggage drop was smooth. The boarding started a bit late but we made up for that en route. Noted that I was flying on a 737 Max 8 type aircraft which had much bigger overhead storage bins and the seat pitch on board was on the generous side which was appreciated. Also the plane was much quieter. However when boarding, most of the flying attendants were busy working in the galleys and were not wishing the passengers which was rather unusual. Also it was observed that in the back of my seat pocket, the safety card was not present which was not good at all as this document is very necessary. The safety instructions and general service also seemed to be rushed on board the cabin. It felt as though the staff just wanted to get things through. Perhaps these factors along with the lack of staff friendliness highlight the issues that the airline is going through at the moment. It is to be noted that there is an onboard wifi named SpiceScreen which one can connect to their mobile devices free of charge. It had a decent selection of movies / podcasts / magazines which was much appreciated. The flight landed on time and baggage collection was done appropriately. On the whole, for the cheap fare that was paid, the service was what was expected and it's true that even though the airline is going through challenges, there are definitely aspects that should be taken care of.",yes

There was a lack of clear communication about the cause of the delay and what steps were being taken to resolve the issue. Furthermore, when the flight finally did depart, it was further delayed due to additional issues with the plane.

You will never find a more boorish, crude and unreasonable airline like them, they kept me at Mumbai Airport for almost 10 hrs, no remorse even for our loss, the important meeting I missed, the expenses I had to endure in these 10 hrs in the airport and complete wastage of time.

After you follow their interface it says your money will be refunded in 21 days and there is no option for fight change.

The terms and condition now is that mother travelling alone will be allowed 7 kg extra. It seems but they are making their own policy standing on the counter and she told me if I don't pay this amount she will put my luggage back outside the counter. I was forced to pay extra for 3 kg although I was in weight limits what was told to me by customer care of SpiceJet and whatever it was told to me on the board accountable was completely incorrect and not mentioned anywhere in the terms and condition of SpiceJet. It seems that the employees of SpiceJet just play with the customers by making their own terms and conditions on basis of their assumptions.

Had to postpone my journey as my wife is pregnant and she couldn’t take a 5 hours since SpiceJet added a stop thereby routing my journey from Mumbai to Jabalpur to Chennai and making a 2 hours direct journey to a 5 hours journey. Left with no other option, I had to shift my journey date to 9th June. Reached airport and there started another another round of drama. Ill mannered, rude and arrogant ground staff at the counter made me stand for 30 mins and then she finally came up with a form which stated that if any things goes wrong with my pregnant wife’s health, the airline will not be responsible for anything including any expense incurred in health. Me, my wife and my 3 year old son- we all were allotted a different seat numbers. Even after requesting multiple time, that lady refused to give us sequential seating arrangement.

This has happened with Delhi to Jabalpur flight in January 2019 as well when they postponed the flight by 7 hours. Why would anyone book a early morning unless one has some work during the day. SpiceJet has ruined the whole program I had, morning as well as evening, not only at Jabalpur but also at my base location because I had not planned any work due to upcoming travel.

The flight was scheduled to land at Shirdi at 4.50pm. Instead, the flight landed at Mumbai at 5.30pm. Announcement was made just before landing at Mumbai. Reason given was storm at Shirdi when actually there was no storm and 3 different flights from Chennai, Tirupati and Vizag (including one ATR) landed around the same time. This was confirmed from local authority at Shirdi. Passengers were in the aircraft for more than 3 hours in Mumbai, during this period there were only 2 announcements, 1st announcement after 1 hour of landing in Mumbai that flight will be taken to Nashik as it could not land in Shirdi after dark. 2nd announcement after 3.5 hours was that passengers were given 3 options: Option 1: stay at Mumbai for the night and go to Shirdi next day. Option 2: Go to Shirdi by bus. Option 3: Go back to Delhi and fly to Shirdi next day. There was utter confusion and no clarity. Passengers lost their patience and naturally got furious. We were deboarded in Mumbai airport around 9.00pm. It took one hour to collect the checked-in luggage as different ground crew announced different conveyor belt Nos (No 1,4,14 and finally 13). Ground staff signed and put stamp on the boarding pass of the passengers after writing full refund of the to ticket charges. On requesting for refund through mail, SpiceJet authorities refuse to refund citing the reason for rescheduling of flight (mail from SpiceJet attached). This is totally misleading information and mismanagement by SpiceJet treating their customers as fools and commodity. SMS/Mail from SpiceJet was about cancellation of the flight which was not correct. The loss of time, mental stress, fatigue and poor communication and misinformation by the Pilot can not be compensated in terms of money.

SpiceJet,2,"""worst customer service""",T Merchant,11th June 2022,"Not Verified |  Spicejet has worst customer service anyone can imagine. I made an advance booking for May 29 2022, but eventually had to get cancelled due to medical reasons. They asked me to forward documents and said they would waive off charges. Eventually the only solution they could offer me was an E voucher that too valid for 180 days. I kept requesting them if not refund then at least give me validity extension cause I won't be able to travel for another 10 months. But all request and mails to higher departments had no effect on them. They stuck to same solutions. I would urge people not to book in advance with them as they have the most stringent rules for the passengers.",no

SpiceJet,1,"""Very disappointed with SpiceJet""",Nawal Bansal,20th May 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Its a Low cost carrier but that does not mean you literally stuff your passenger inside the aircraft. There was no leg space. We (me and my wife) had to sit for 2 hours in the same position. On top of this, we were assigned the last seat (36th row) and the seats weren’t recliner. No space behind. Buses provide best and comfortable seats these days. Very disappointed with SpiceJet. I wish I never get to travel with this carrier in my future.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""extremely disappointed with the experience""",Manish Mukhija,20th May 2022,Not Verified |  I am extremely disappointed with the experience I am having with SpiceJet. First the flight was rescheduled 5 times between yesterday and today morning. It started at 8:15 am from Dubai instead of 22:40 PM yesterday. Wait time at airport was extremely long for the flight to take off. To my surprise I did not receive my bag at the airport for such a short flight and no transit in between I have an important function to attend tomorrow and there is perishable stuff in the suitcase. SpiceJet service and handling has spoiled my entire trip and left me in very difficult situation. I just called their customer care number. Wait time was close to 1 hour for an agent to pick and there was no definite response when my luggage will be loaded and when I will receive. Looks like airlines support staff is clueless.,no
SpiceJet,1,"""Unable to get my baggage from the flight""",Kush Goel,20th May 2022,Not Verified |  Unable to get my baggage from the flight.

I am a 6 month pregnant woman and on 10nd April their staff was just utterly ignorant. Me and my husband were trying to check in our luggage, my husband was in longer queue and I stood on the new counter, the lady who was checking in told me that I should wait while other guys check in, I am not in a condition to stand for long so I told her I am pregnant and first in queue, she made weird faces and tried to ignore that's where my husband had to intervene. There were no courtesy whatsoever. Second, while we were on flight, the hostess didn't give me any instruction even though I told her I was pregnant. I paid for the food and beverage for both me and my husband, and our name wasn't there on the list, there was a long hassle to prove that we paid for the same. Although the Airhostess offered us the same later but proving that you have paid wasn't really a 5* experience.",no

Cabin was ok, legroom was ok wrt LCC, not too cramped, looks fresh and clean. They also offers complimentary IFE through WIFI, can be used on personal mobile/tab/laptop.

Never in my life have I paid for my laptop bag. And they charge for duty free weight. The ticket was of 6k inr and they charge me 5k for my laptop bag which was only 5kg. And the worst part is they ask for money at the last spot where we have to board the flight. So that the passenger is not left with any other option.,no

I had to catch a plane from Goa to New Delhi. However, by mistake I booked my flight from New Delhi to Goa. I had lost all my hopes of retrieving my money but their employee helped me greatly. Even though it was a commercial line, she kept guiding me for around 40 minutes. Not only did she help me save around Rs. 17,000, she advised me step by step throughout the call on how to carry out the process. I'm deeply indebted to her from the bottom of my heart and really congratulate them for having such a caring and helpful agent. Thank you so much for your support and cooperation SpiceJet.",yes
SpiceJet,1,"""won’t recommend to anyone""",R Karnuda,20th March 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  The worst flight I have ever experienced. They count your luggage at per person instead of weight. No service at all. The crew doesn’t provide proper snacks if you pay for it at time of booking the flight. At the time of snacks they gives you 2 biscuits and a 10 rupees juice. When we demanded tea or coffee they make lame excuses. They charge extra for luggage without checking their weight. Worst flight ever. I am not travelling Spicejet ever again and won’t recommend to anyone.,no

We paid for priority check in and Spice Max but we literally had to beg for all the services we were entitled to, in fact their staff asked us to get into the regular queues and wait saying there are no priority services, we literally had to fight for it. Also this airline makes you pay extra for what you shop from duty free! They weigh your cabin baggage again after check in before you enter the flight and ask you to pay. Horrible experience and wouldn’t recommend it to anyone!",no
SpiceJet,1,"""literally the worst situation""",Tanvi Sharma,20th March 2022,"Not Verified | I had a flight scheduled on 8th Jan' 22 from Mum to Sri (SG 944). Due to bad weather conditions in Srinagar, the flight got cancelled which is understandable. The flight was almost full. So instead of getting us on another flight the next day, they told us that all the direct flights for the next day are cancelled and are also full for the upcoming 3 days. They are then providing us indirect flight via Delhi after 2 days. I am still following up with my accomodation issues in Kashmir for change in dates and not sure if i will get a refund for my hotel bookings. Also, they are not adjusting us for direct flights and i have to additionally budget my stay option in Delhi for one night as well. How can an airline be so ignorant to the travellers since we are the reason you guys have business. My cancelled flight was almost full, and they could have simply scheduled another flight for the next day. But they are now giving us indirect flights at the charge of direct flights which is generally higher. The staff was lying to the crowd that the direct flights are cancelled and giving us indirect flights. And at the same time, they were taking a few passengers to the side and booking them on direct flights. I was one of them but they later told me that the direct flight just got fully booked but don't tell the rest of the passengers that the flights are operating. This is literally the worst situation any airline has put me through.",no

I had travelled all the way from Solapur to Mumbai to catch my early morning flight to Jabalpur and after standing there in the check-in line for 2 hours they say your flight has been rescheduled to the evening after 12 hours and no communication was made to me for this rescheduling. In fact I was getting upgrading and priority services messages but no message for flight been delayed. The staff at Mumbai airport didn't even bother to convey this very well. Pathetic airline. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone.,no

They have this weird rule that you have to web check in 1 hour before the flight and they don't have the facility to check in physically at the terminal. My father-in law who was the passenger who was returning from Pune to Hyderabad was a senior citizen and was returning back after attending the death ritual of a relative had a harrowing time with arrogant staff who were not willing to help him. They said they will refund the airfare but fingers crossed. Show me the money and then I will believe. Some thing is wrong with SpiceJet. Lots of problems. Too many flight delays, cancellations. We should avoid this Airline.",no

The auto-reply said 'Will get back to you within 3 working days'. Who waits for three days to get an answer to such small issue? The airline staff of Bagdogra also badly handled my bag and broke the belts and wheels out of one bag.,no

I bought the gift card from their site, and while applying it is showing transaction error. After contacting them, they said it will take 3 working days to resolve the issue. It's been more than 10days now, they have not taken any action, flight rates are now sky high and they are not even ready to refund the gift card amount. This is a trick to lure their customers to prepay for the gift card and then not let them use it so that after a certain period of time they can charge them more for the same trip.",no

But the cabin crew were helpful and the food I purchased onboard was also of good quality. Once I arrived at the airport and began boarding, everything went well. But the trouble is that my original booking was of a 4-5 hour journey duration, but the airline changed the route and connection, so today I am travelling for more than 8 hours, which is a lot for a domestic flight. Also, there were several revisions of route and time before the actual journey, which got me rather stressed.",yes

As per notification, we (including other passengers) were at Gate # 21. At the last moment (around 11.00 am) the ground staff came and informed us that the Gate was changed to 106. When we reached Gate # 106, we were informed that the Gate was closed and boarding can not be allowed. On argument, we were allowed boarding. The ground staff were abusive saying ""Are you illiterate?"" and ""I am doing Ehshaan (favour) by allowing you all to board"". I have never experienced such issue any time in the past.

SpiceJet cancelled the Flight. I cancelled my tickets on 22-Aug-2021 when received the Flight cancellation message and opted for full refund. Even after 26 days, I have not got the refund. The customer care initially told that it will take 15 days to get the refund. 15 days withholding the money for cancelling the Flight for their own benefit (other 2 airlines were operating on the same day, same route, same timing) shows their commitment to the customers. The worst part is even after 15 days no refund received.  Even after 26 days the refund is not received.",no

So Chennai to Mumbai and Mumbai to Goa. The waiting time in Mumbai is 6+ hours. I wrote to customer relations, asking them, since there is no alternate flights available, its our daughters first birthday and she was so nagging and I requested them atleast provide a lounge or room considering the infant as it is 6+ hours. I got no response for that until 12th September. When you call customer care, one have to nearly wait 40+ minutes to speak to respective person in-charge. Again, via return, the direct flight has been cancelled. We took a flight from Goa to Bangalore and Bangalore to Chennai with 3+ hours waiting time in Bangalore.  There was a time change again, from Goa to Bangalore and we re-booked our cab. We had a very worst experience with Spicejet. All they say, the change is due to operational reasons.

No information at the time of deboarding. We are running all over Delhi T3 catching hold of random Spicejet employees and seeking help. How could they leave without passengers who were already issued boarding pass? Why did they not assign somebody to take care of us when we alighted in transit at Delhi T3. Worst is that they kept offering refund to passengers who are in transit. Finally they put us on the next days flight which again we had to insist upon.

I wish there would have 0 star rating to give because they don't even deserve 1 star. They changed our flight timings at first due to which we had to change our other events timimg. Later on airport our baggage was not loaded. We had to wait 2 to 3 days to have our baggage. They were not even sorry for the same and the airport staff was very rude to help us in that situation. As a part of compensation they promised us 1500 voucher written on the attachment top. But still not received it. Even after several calls and emails they are not replying anything on the voucher status.. Not answering the calls either. Dont know why they charge so much money for such a worst service. I will never recommend using Spicejet ever to anyone. I had a worst experience ever with the airport staff. And due to no great response from customer service i believe this airlines is not a price worthy. Better use other airlines than spicejet.,no
SpiceJet,1,"""an unethical airline""",S Targan,23rd August 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Spicejet are an unethical airline. They cancelled our flight in March 2020 and promised a full refund. More than 15 months later we are still waiting for that refund. SpiceJet's charter states refunds are issued within 7 days if purchased tickets by credit card. The Supreme Court of India ruled that Spicejet must pay out refunds by 31st March 2021. SpiceJet are in in serious breach of contact and legal ruling. For the last 15 months we have been in contact with SpiceJet's consumer relations, nodal officer and appellate.",no

Asked to refund to take alternate flight and asked who will pay for stay and food, They refused to refund the ticket amount, they suggest to cancel the ticket but told cancellation charge will applicable. See they want to do cancellation charge for the flight which was cancelled, flight which was not in schedule. After long fight alternate flight was given from Delhi, on next day 27th. Their response in this manner was totally abnormal.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""I had to spent an entire night at the airport""",Pragya Mishra,23rd August 2021,"Not Verified |  SpiceJet is the most pathetic airline service out of all available services in India. They can cancel the reservation at any moment of time and will leave you hanging. Happened with me twice, being a solo female traveller I had to spent an entire night at the airport because they cancelled the flight. This happened again today. Just don't go for SpiceJet if you have any other options available.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""staff is very unprofessional and arrogant""",V Pakaran,23rd August 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Their ground staff is very unprofessional and arrogant. I observed that hand baggage weight limit policy of 7kg is applied to only certain customers. I have been waiting in the que for boarding and in front of me many customers gone with higher weight and in my turn I had 2 kg extra and I have been instructed to pay 60Dhs per kg for excess weight. I honour their terms and conditions but my question is that the policy should be uniform to all customers. I don’t understand the logic behind different terms according to the face value of customers. They are favouring some customers according to their wish and relaxed for more than 10kg. When I tried to ask this to their ground staff, they were so arrogant and impatient. They kicked me out from the que and rudely told if you don’t want to pay throw your item. I have been travelling in this sector for past 17 years and used many carriers. Never experienced such behavior earlier. When I entered the flight, again surprising that there is no space to keep my hand baggage. They have collected such a heavy amount and I had to keep that items below my seat compromising leg space.  When I shared my experience to their customer service team later, they come up with copy paste of standard reply format justifying their terms. Be aware about their standard so that you will not have disappointment.",no

With regards to what I can carry and what I can't carry also guided me in check-in and hand luggage which made me really feel at ease as I was a single lady passenger and with the pandemic situation so I was scared and all. Apart from that I really loved him for his excellent communication skills, open-minded and friendliness, his professionalism, his passion for his work, excellent work ethic, courtesy, his manners, friendliness and open-minded attitude towards cultural awareness and he knows how to treat a passenger like a guest in his own home with respect without any discrimination unlike what I saw at Mumbai airport how poor people are treated. He also had put priority and transfer tag on my luggage so it gets loaded separately as promised by him, excited to see the bag come out 1st and that was very sweet of him. He is an excellent example of what customer service is. Though he didn't do my check in he has left a mark on me and he is the reason I wish to fly with Spicejet again and see more staff like him and his excellent habits",yes

When I reached at the gate, I saw almost everyone with so much of luggage and I happened to ask a female who was carrying the same combination of hand luggage as mine. She said she did not pay for any extra luggage. It was visible that so many of the travellers were carrying more than one bag of hand luggage.

Proper behaviour, patience, and hospitality! Perfect example of how a crew should be.

When asked they just replied saying cannot do anything about it. Top of that there is no PPE kit provided for the middle seat. But the air hostesses are wearing the kits. Does that mean passengers are not vulnerable to the virus but the staff are. Also, if you wanna do web check in for two people for two seat & keep it together, they are charging 800 bucks.",no

SpiceJet,1,"""nothing is special on their flights""",Jaideep Singh,29th January 2021,"✅ Trip Verified | I have travelled on many flights but SpiceJet was worst experience. They lack ethics, professionalism and most importantly they do not know how to talk to their customers. We were travelling from Goa to Mumbai and we arrived 50 mins prior to boarding and the queue was long, when our turn came they said we were late and they would not provide us with boarding passes. We pleaded with to them but their attitude was so rude. After pleading for 20 mins they gave us boarding passes because we had already done online check in. After all this drama I finally boarded the flight 15 mins early, if they haven’t made this an issue I would have boarded half an hour earlier. I really recommend to please learn hospitality from other airlines, I also travelled with Vistara, Indigo, GoAir and Air India, if their customers are late they actually look for you and make you board the flight without making it an issue. Then why not with SpiceJet, nothing is special on their flights. Timings of their flights are changing frequently without any prior information.",no

However we would like to draw your attention to one of the bad incidents. Our seats were 3A and 3B and entered the flight almost at the end of the boarding process. We were trying to accommodate our hand baggage within the available space within the overhead compartment. In between one person occupying seat 1F started shouting us not to touch his bags! We were thinking that it is a crazy passenger but later on found from the crew that it is the captain of Spicejet. It was a shocking moment and we have never came across such an arrogant airline staff, whether national OR international carrier. We are not able to understand how can Spicejet afford such a bad person as your captain especially during this COVID season. We tried to complain to the crew but it was of no use since the captain is above all of them.",yes

I had planned to checkin my stroller and the hand luggages along with others since i was alone. I've done this with many other airlines in similar situations. However, today was a nightmare. Apparently i had to pay for checking in the above mentioned or carry them all with me. I was utterly shocked of the lady at the counter for behaving in such a rude way. She told me to open the stroller and take it back. So i had to carry the 7kg hand luggage of my baby, 7kg hand luggage of mine and my daughter with the stroller in my hand. And by the time I reached the plane i was truly exhausted. I had back ache and plane was hot. It had only paid food and the seating wasn't comfortable either. What is the point in paying for the infant if they don't have a seat, luggage allowance or food. The plane got delayed, I was starving and tired. And when I got off the plane the stroller wasn't there.  I had to wait for the stroller after I've received all my suitcases. So what was the point in making me suffer if it all went in the same plane. Worst experience ever. Never choosing this airline ever again.",no

SpiceJet,1,"""I am not at all satisfied""",N Garshan,8th December 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my experience with SpiceJet and I am not at all satisfied with the services provided.  First of all booking page says that it's a non stop flight of duration of 4:20hrs but it's not. (BLR-DEL) Secondly return flight was of 4:20hrs (says non-stop) but it's not. It's via Pune and now the halt has been increased from 30min to 6hrs. There is no use of utilising flight as it's wasting my whole day with a halt of 6hrs. Now while cancelling this return ticket of around Rs 4.2K, te refund amount calculated is just Rs 572. So it's like I had money and I have wasted this with SpiceJet. Kindly review your service and enhance the customer service/booking interface or at least provide clarity to customers. Please don't lie.

However she tried her best to look if there was non available with her crew member at the back. Unfortunately there was not. She came back to me and offered a few munchies for which I denied. What really impressed me was, she truly was concerned about me being hungry and she offered me her meal saying sir I can offer you my meal, please have it. This gesture of hers made my day. I never expected such care and warmth, she was very grounded and so real, not like she was doing her job.

After Landing staff assisted me to tie my bandages around and wear my shoes. She wore a Pair of Gloves sprayed sanitisers on the shoes and helped me tie the laces.

I had to draft this mail because I was so pleased with the hospitality that the aircrew exhibited. The air hosts and air hostesses were very kind and pleasant in their communication with passengers. Also to note was how they kept the washroom sanitized after every five passengers had accessed it. I personally had a very bad headache that day and they helped me overcome that by providing excellent service. They were very polite (although I know it is their job). The steward was very kind to first ask me if I had taken food before getting me a pill and lukewarm water (this matters because medicines have to be taken after food and with lukewarm water and not every flight steward/stewardess bothers to make sure if the passenger has eaten something and if the temperature of the water is right). After this, the stewardess approached me a second time to enquire if I was doing okay and if I needed something which I thought was a very sweet and generous gesture from their side and I was so satisfied and happy because I had never received that kind of treatment on any flight before. I know it is the job of an air host/hostess to attend to the passengers, but to date, on every flight I've been to, none of them have come back to enquire about my health after attending to me once. This gesture, even though it was small, made me feel so contented and I'm pleased to have had the chance to be a passenger on board this flight.

Then they decided to only provide a credit shell for the outgoing flight, not the return flight (no airline cancels an outgoing flight but keeps the return flight - completely against all procedures), finally they added a credit note that is not even valid for a year. When we tried to use the credit note, however it was not possible to apply the note on an online booking, all helpline numbers for the company are not active, and no one replied to an email sent requesting immediate assistance.

I traveled from United States to India with two check-in bags and week later I booked a domestic flight in Spicejet. Ticket cost INR 6000+ and also I purchased extra baggage allowance for my 2nd check-in that cost INR 12000+ and total cost is INR18205. Little did I know that I am not qualified to carry my 2nd check-in that cost INR12000. So I contacted customer service and apparently it's not refundable. So I asked them cancel the entire ticket and cancellation charge cost INR4000 even though I purchased their own so called insurance. Their check-in baggage allowance weight is 20kg (44lbs) which is the least of least of airlines I flew so far. I am a very frequent flyer and have been flying from last 15 years in western countries and never ever this happened in any other airlines. These fares are totally unreasonable even for western standards for a 50 mins flight. Come on Spicejet, you can do way better.",no

But now after 3rd failure, when I called them and ask my money back so first they says it not their policy and they will keep money as credit shell. But after long talk they gave me assurance for return the money. But it was all just a joke. Also, their CS team gives misinformation and I filed a complaint twice to them.

I have been mailing them for weeks trying to contact them to cancel my flight or at least reschedule it but they are not responding at all. The customer care staff is the worst they do not really care about their customers at all. All that matters is money. Once the payment is done they do not care about anybody. Even at this time when the world is fighting Corona they expect me to either board in the flight else I will be refunded on 380 rupees for tickets costing 16000. In case I want to reschedule my flight I will have to pay rupees 3000 per passenger which is illogical. They keep telling us their policies which I believe are not for such epidemic situations.

There is no way to cancel a booking through their web site, and their phone numbers only worked once out of the 30+ times I tried them!

SpiceJet,1,"""horrible customer care""",A Postma,17th March 2020,Not Verified |  Colombo to Chennai via Mumbai. The main reason for reviewing SpiceJet is their horrible customer care and their way of communicating. So we tried booking on their website but after payment their website didn't work and we didn't receive the tickets. After calling and emailing for at least 20 times the past month they keep asking the same questions without any progress. We're still waiting for our money back. Also the way they handled the communication around the corona virus and the forms you needed to fill was unclear. We ended up waiting after arrival with the whole plane grouped up filling in extra forms that we didn't receive from SpiceJet.,no

I usually fly spicemax most of the time to have convenience and to save time but that generally doesn't happen. I have tried to provide feedback multiple times through their portal about their spicemax program but mostly it seems they are least bothered about customer feedback or customer satisfaction. Almost 90% of the time spicemax doesn't mean anything for SpiceJet crew. I believe their crew lacks proper training or they don't care for people onboard. I believe they should focus to make this program more robust so that people would feel like paying for the additional facilities. If they treat the same to all than why would one pay the premium to avail additional services.,no

The dinner was pre-booked consisting of tawa fish and daal with rice. During the check in all the luggages were checked in a proper manner. However, there was a delay of around 45 mins or so. The seats were comfortable enough for a 2 hour 40 minute journey. The service on-board was quite nice and the crew were attentive. The pre flight meal was also quite nice and also had a plum cake and yogurt for dessert. We landed at Mumbai 1 hour after the scheduled arrival time, but the delay was of little consequence.

Our return flight time was 5:25 am and we reached the airport at 4:45. We were declined boarding passes because they said we need to arrive 45 mins prior and despite of begging the staff to give us our boarding passes they were rude.  We were told that they had already started boarding on the flight and we would not be able to reach the gate in time. This was a really horrible experience. They told me that I would have to pay 1 lakh and 20 thousand rupees for just the return ticket which I of course did not buy. I ended up paying 85000 rupees for the return ticket with a different airline. I will never use or suggest Spicejet to any one.,no

SpiceJet,7,"""flight itself was pretty nice""",S Vashun,15th February 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bengaluru to Kolkata by SpiceJet. As this was a transfer flight to my final destination in Kolkata, the process was very smooth and boarding started well ahead of schedule. Again this flight by a former Jet Airways Boeing 737 and the crew seemed affable enough. I had pre booked the non veg and veg lunch meal for my family members which consisted of a chicken and egg biriyani as the non veg option and veg biriyani as the veg option. The food also had a bun and a cup of yoghurt and even though the meal was not bad, the quantities seemed to be on the lesser side. Landing was in time however I noticed that as the passengers were de-boarding, the crew did not thank the passengers and they had their backs turned instead of thanking the passengers and this was maybe the only negative in what was by and large a very good flight. The pre booked meal on Spicejet seemed to be of more quantity compared to other rival low cost carriers operating in India but still if one has to purchase in flight, it can get expensive as it starts from 250 INR onwards. Even though LCCs are in the habit of maximizing revenue as much as possible, one can be smart about this and perhaps have food before the flight. The flight itself was pretty nice.",yes
SpiceJet,7,"""should not have much expectations""",V Hanush,15th February 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Bengaluru by SpiceJet. For this morning service, there was massive lines for the baggage drop but eventually was able to drop the checked in luggage. It is important to come well in advance as one could easily miss their flight due to the serpentine nature of the queues. Before dropping the bags, it is important to print the boarding passes / bag tags from the kiosks. The flight was operated by a former Jet Airways aircraft, so the seating was more on the spacious side. Departure and arrival was on time. The crew were also good. I had asked for a glass of water only to be told that she would be giving me later but never did. Thankfully there was another crew member who provided the water. Unfortunately, for my aunt, the crew never really provided her any water when she made a similar request. As the flight was full, the crew managed to slowly get the service done but they did it quite well. While de-boarding, the crew thanked all the passengers which was good.

This is probably going to be my last flight at Spice Jet, SG-272 had my worst experience ever, now the flight has been delayed but i have been on delayed flights before this but this takes it to new heights because my flight was to depart at 9:25 but I received notification that it was going to depart at 1:45 pm at 11:15 am which was already 2 hours after the original departure time. All other flights namely indigo were departing at their times normally only spice jet planes somehow didn't take off, thats just so problematic. Then again I received a message on my phone at 1 pm that it was going to take off at 2:30 then finally it took off at 3pm. When we landed the crew were least bothered to know the belt number the luggage is going to be available at, they said it was going to be at belt-8 but it was available at 9 which i found out on enquiring separately, after waiting almost 15-20 minutes at Belt-8 which stopped.

SpiceJet,1,"""Truly a horrendous experience""",C Garlen,7th December 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Kochi. Our problems started at the check-in desk, where the woman checking us in visibly rolled her eyes at us when we approached the counter. When we arrived in Kochi, I was informed that my bag had been kept in Mumbai because of a powerbank (which the check-in lady did not ask us about). Now, I understand why they have this policy, and that's not the problem I had with SpiceJet, as I realize that part is my fault. The problem was how SpiceJet customer service handled it. No information, hanging up on me every time I called to check the status of my bag, needing me to send the appropriate paperwork multiple times before removing the powerbank and sending me my bag (which took over 48 hours). I don't understand why it's so difficult to simply remove the powerbank (which I gave permission to do) and send the bag. Yet for some reason, the people who work for this airline are completely incompetent. Not only that, but I received a message on WhatsApp that my bag was arriving on a certain flight, so I drove 1.5 hours to pick it up. But when I arrived, the bag was not on the flight! Instead, it was on the next flight which landed 3 hours later. Since we were about to leave Kochi and go to Alleppey, I had to wait for it. I spoke with the people working at the SpiceJet counter in Kochi airport, who didn't seem to care at all and kept saying ""well maybe it will come tomorrow"". I made it clear I wasn't leaving without the bag, and told them I'd wait for the next flight. I left to get some food, and when I returned, no one was there -- the counter was closed. Fortunately I was able to get the terminal manager to help me get my bag, but if they weren't going to be there, why the hell didn't they just say so when I told them I'd be returning? Truly a horrendous experience with SpiceJet customer service, both in person and on the phone -- completely unhelpful in every way possible. The second time we flew SpiceJet was no better, as we were charged double the price of our ticket to change our flight by one day (even though online it says you only have to pay the difference of the fares, which is a lie). On top of that, there were over $100 of hidden fees added to the ticket price, which we were not informed about until it was time to pay. We were told we either had to pay it, or we'd lose our current flight AND the new reservation. Nothing about this airline makes sense, worst customer service I've ever experienced.",no

The employee at the counter very generously agreed to change it and assign me an aisle seat. Well, it was a rude shock upon boarding to see that my original seat was indeed an exit seat. Why would the airline staff mislead a fare-paying passenger? More surprises. After a 2 hour delay, the flight crew was busy providing sample drinks and indulging in small talk with a group of passengers without any consideration that the rest of the passengers were trying to get some sleep.

The airline policy clearly states that each passenger is allowed cabin bag of maximum 7kgs and hand bag free of cost. We were a group of 13 people, and accordingly every passenger is allowed a cabin bag and a hand bag free of cost, but staff was hell bent on making us pay extra for the hand bag (which is essentially my purse). He was rude, and has no idea what he was talking. We have been frequent flyers with Spicejet and usually the staff is very polite and considerate.

She asked me whether I had sipped the beverage. I answered, of course. But she didn’t believe me. To my utter surprise, she asked another co-passenger, who was also having tea, whether his beverage was hot enough. He responded, might be, 'yes'. She then turned to me and said, he is saying the tea is hot enough. To my utter disbelief, she poured some water from the pot. I didn't say anything but kept the cup full of tea or to be precise some lukewarm water and a piece of biscuit. I could have argued that my co passenger purchased the beverage when she began serving and I purchased while she was coming back from one round. But I didn't say anything. But I wonder how could a lady pour some water, maybe to her belief hot enough, to the cup of tea without even thinking that what would be the taste of the beverage.

SpiceJet flight from Delhi to Bengaluru. This was a very good flight where everything went very smoothly from check in using the kiosk machines to the baggage drop, everything was flawless. The boarding started before the scheduled time which was a plus point and the flight was very full. One slight disadvantage is the need to pre pay the seat while doing online check in. However, if one arrives at the airport early enough one can select their seat preference without needing to pay the additional cost. But then this is a practice most LCCs do. The plane itself was used formerly by Jet Airways, so the seat pitch was on the more generous side which was well appreciated for a trip that was lasting 2 hours and 50 minutes long. We took off before departure time, the crew were proactive and personable enough with the fellow passengers when it came to the food / drinks. The pilots also announced and kept us updated regarding the flight path. Arrival was also well before the scheduled time and collecting the baggage was done quickly without the need to wait for long. Overall I'd say that on flights with longer durations, having a seat pitch which is more on the generous side really helps a lot. Would I consider flying SpiceJet again? If there is a good deal available.",yes

SpiceJet manged to be delayed (departure time) on 5 out of 4 planned flights: one flight was so delayed that I would not catch the connecting flight in Delhi - and I was not let on board. Thus I had to stay in Bangkok for one more day (no compensation for the hotel whatsoever). The next day, the plane was overcrowded - forget the extra leg room! Also, staff were always checking x-times if I was entitled for something to drink. It was an unpleasant and embarrassing experience. I will try to avoid SpiceJet at any cost.

First they are taking undue advantage of your situation and charging heavily for any excess baggage (approx 1400 INR per kg). I paid 15k for my excess baggage and they did that for most passengers and later all of our baggage was left behind as they did not have enough space in the flight and no information was provided to us. They just keep making money by accepting all there is to take. Upon landing in Pune they informed us what they have done and delivered a lot of false promises about refunds and compensation to pacify us. Later when I followed up with their customer care they didn't even bother to reply; cause they know they have already got the money and later when I complained again they bluntly refused to pay any compensation or refunds. They are extremely unprofessional and liars and cheats.

In particular, the staff on Kolkata-Chennai segment was very helpful, courteous, and pleasant. It's the crew that makes the airline, truly. On the other hand, the systems of SpiceJet are broken. Two examples: (1) On this same route, I had a ticket with all three segments under the same Record Locator. However, since a flight was modified by the reservation staff, their internal system showed them under different locators so I had to manually collect baggage and check-in baggage at every point - three check-ins, three baggage collections, and two re-check-ins! This needs to change. Airlines exist for customers, customers don't exist for airlines. (2) On a previous reservation that was cancelled by SpiceJet and refunded in full, the full refund was issued as a new transaction rather than reversal of the previous charge.

SpiceJet,1,"""One of the worst experiences""",Deepali Bhamare,18th September 2019,"Not Verified |  Mumbai to Chennai. One of the worst experiences I’ve ever had with a flight. I was stuck in traffic and I knew I wouldn’t be able to make it before 45 mins, so I called the airline and they said they’d mark my PNR and send their staff to help me with the stuff. On reaching the airport and literally pushing everyone aside turns out there was no spicejet guy there to help us out. Moreover when we reached the check-in counter they refused to accept that we had our PNR nums marked and said that they couldn’t help us at all. Later, the senior executive came and spoke to us. Honestly, she couldn’t help us with the situation at all and later when we told her about the call center person who told us she’d arrange help, the senior executive asked for her name and asked us to call her back and if we couldn’t do that we could book another flight. She had a lot of attitude and just showed that she was least bothered in helping us. They have stupid officials at their call center who just know what to say or what to do. I’d strictly recommend anyone reading this to never use Spicejet as they have horrible services. This is just one of the most disastrous experiences I’ve ever had with any of the airlines. Later on, we had to book another flight to get back so yes we chose indigo which is a way better flight than spicejet. We had to book our tickets at the airport itself and since the ticket counter was very crowded the indigo official took us to book our tickets, took our baggage and made it very hassle free for us.",no
SpiceJet,5,"""ran out of all possible food options""",Mohammed Nishal,18th September 2019,✅ Trip Verified | Kochi to Malé with SpiceJet. It was a mixed experience. They ran out of all possible food options by the 3rd row of the service itself. We got to choose only some nuts and biscuits only. Crew were having either a take it or leave it attitude so didn’t expect much from them either. Nevertheless it was a decent flight with average seating.,yes

From begining to end you will be dissatisfied and left irritated. The web check fails often, the physical check in counter is not easily available nor any instructions. The staff have a poor attitude so don't expect any actual help. The planes are not the best or even good ones. They seem too old for 2019. Inflight service is alright. Staff have the same attitude in the air as on the ground. If your bag is detained, don't expect them to let you know. You'll have to find out yourself, and they'll do little to help besides bringing the bag to the city. No inflight internet. Overall terrible service and experience. Would not recommend.",no

Will never travel again by Spicejet.",no
SpiceJet,2,"""have never had such a disgusting experience""",Soham Panchamiya,18th September 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | An utterly terrible experience. My baggage was removed from the plane along with several other passengers. We were only informed about this after we had waited at the baggage rack for an hour in Dubai. This was at 12pm. Thereafter, we were told to come back at 3pm as our baggage would be flown in by then. Even though SpiceJet caused the issue, they refused to have our baggage delivered and they refused to compensate for costs to go to and from the airport (which is quite high in Dubai). When I got back to the airport to pick up my baggage at 3, they delayed further and we waited until 4.30-5 to get our luggage. The SpiceJet manager at Dubai airport refused to speak to us and was literally hiding in the SpiceJet office. Look, these things happen, but it is the airline's responsibility to do everything it can to ensure no further trouble is caused. I have never had such a disgusting experience with any other airline and will never, ever travel with SpiceJet ever again.",no
SpiceJet,3,"""I am highly disappointed""",Akansha Singh Gautam,18th September 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chennai to Guwahati via Kolkata. I am highly disappointed by their service. I had requested them to put my baggage in the priority list and had paid extra as I was in a hurry for a bus which was soon after my flight. I have had travelled in Spicejet before and with my experience I already had a feeling that my Spicejet flight might be late; this is why I had demanded for the facility. But even then, they didn't put any priority tag on my luggage and my luggage arrived 15 mins late at the Guwahati airport. My first flight was 40 mins late, the next one being 20 mins late. I think spicejet needs to improve their services and at least provide the required services for the paid stuff, if not free. Never travelling with spicejet again, unless that'd be my last option.",no

SpiceJet,1,"""nothing less than shameful""",Rakesh Rachwani,8th August 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Mumbai, the experience of flying spice jet was nothing less than shameful.  With spice jet you should be careful while checking in, yes I understand 30kg is your limit, but I saw a gentleman being asked to remove even 1 kg extra. It's of course the airline policy but this was certainly something a airline staff could have handled better. Having checked in without any fuss, luckily, I was  excited as I was taking my 1st international trip with spice jet.  No one was allowed to check in hand luggage over 7 kgs, which includes duty free spirits and other items bought.  10000 rupees for hand carry without warning is insane.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""our whole trip was ruined""",Ujjval Jain,8th August 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had booked four tickets from Spice Jet to fly from Pune to Cochin.  It was a pre-planned holiday and two out of four were on their honeymoon. We had everything booked and scheduled - the cab, itinerary, hotel bookings and everything was paid in advance. Spice Jet being such a reputed and big airline spoiled the whole holiday with their unprofessional ignorant attitude.  We reached the Pune airport at 10 a.m. on 29 July as our flight was scheduled to fly at 11:25 a.m. and we issued the boarding pass on the kiosk and the same was sent to us on WhatsApp by Spice Jet team. We proceeded for the security check. Upon reaching there the security officer asked us to report at the check-in counter, at the counter we were shocked to know that the flight had been delayed by four and a half hours and later got cancelled due to some technical issues. Spice Jet officials straight away denied that they cannot do anything about it and we have to see something else on our own. After a lot of heated argument they agreed on shifting us to the immediate next flight from the Pune airport but we were given wrong information about the available flights too. There was a Go Air flight at around 1 p.m. which we agreed on taking to and later on they refused us to accommodate in that flight. We did not know what to do as we had a schedule to follow right after our landing in Cochin.  When we requested them for some other options, we were told there was a flight at 4 - 4:30 p.m. Indigo flight which is a direct flight to Cochin. We agreed as there were no other seats available in any other flight. But when I checked it online, it was via Bangalore that was taking about six hours to reach Cochin. Had I not checked it, they would have shifted us there with this misinformation. This is such an unprofessional behavior. If the flight is cancelled last minute then ethically they should support their customer who is suffering because of the last minute cancellation rather than giving up on them and providing them with wrong information. Then I checked the online flights available and saw Go Air had an available flight from Mumbai at 5:20 p.m. which was landing at 7:35 p.m. which was still suitable as we had time to reach the hotel at least. Spice Jet team first did not agree to this then after requesting to SpiceJet senior team member that our entire money will go waste, earlier he refused but after pursuing him a lot he booked us in the Go Air flight from Mumbai. The Spice Jet person after booking it told us that your bookings are done and we’ll offload you from the airport and you go and get a taxi on your own at around 11:45 a.m. Pune to Mumbai taxi fares are high, we were not prepared for it and also we were not liable to paid it too. When I requested they out rightly refused, after a lot of argument they agreed for the taxi. We took our flight from Mumbai and landed at Cochin at 7:30 p.m. Our whole day was spoiled because of the last minute flight cancellation. We are middle class people, we plan the holidays in advance and take a fixed budget. After this, our whole trip was ruined.",no

The real problem that my family faced was that Spice Jet offloaded their baggage without informing them, so my wife kept waiting at the belt for 2 hours at the belt at Delhi Airport only to be told that the baggage will come with next flight. What is this?  No airline ever offloaded our baggage before without our permission. With falling standards, this Airline will not fly for long.",no

No hassle. Then I was asked to pay for my laptop bag weight as well, which was unjustifiable. Never ever I paid for my laptop bag as an extra carry on bag in last 10 years. No other flights charge such an extra bag fee. I agreed to pay for the laptop bag as well, but asked the spicejet staff their IDs which they declined to provide, they get all our information and unwilling to provide their IDs, which would help me to complain against them.

I didn't buy anything since I had ate at the airport however, so I cannot comment about the food. On my return flight back to Hyderabad, I was put on an older Dash-8, which meant smaller seats, no reclining, and harder everything. Before/after this flight, I flew on IndiGo's ATR-72 from Tirupati to Hyderabad, which was so much better. If you want a cheap flight in India, don't choose SpiceJet, choose IndiGo, or even Air Asia India. Sometimes, Air India will be the cheapest option, which is a total win for me on a domestic flight, but not so internationally.

As a result of that, we missed our connection at Ahmedabad which was reasonably spaced at 3h from us landing. Upon landing we went to SpiceJet kiosk and staff was incredibly unhelpful telling us we need to buy new tickets to our destination. We ended up outside the airport, not being able to go back in arrivals or go into departures as we did not have a boarding ticket.

Due to this delay, I missed my flight from Mumbai to Bhopal. I complained to spicejet by email but they just say due to operational reasons it got delayed and no compensation can be provided at all. After few email exchanges they don't even bother about customers' concerns. I found their cabin crew is also rude and does not know how to treat their customers in flight.

They fooled me to buy Spice max for privileged services, but it has been pathetic so far..

My luggage was suspended in Mumbai airport and later I found that the reason was that I had a power bank inside my luggage. Spicejet said that they tried to call me but couldn’t get through as my no was an international one. They knew I had a UK no and Obviously anyone knows that they should have dialed 0044 before dialing my no? I checked in about 7:40 and there was plenty of time for them to inform me prior to taking off. Why didn’t they use the communication speaker sound system to call my name? I travelled all the way from the UK and Spicejet has managed to destroy my stay, why? I phoned the extremely unhelpful “helpline “some 5 times but they acted very unprofessional and were not helpful the slightest. I had all my very necessary belongings including my medicines in the luggage. There was no information anywhere re. Power bank restriction.  The check in staff could easily have either phoned me or called me through the airport speaking sound system. The Mumbai staff could have phoned the Cochin staff and informed them that my luggage was suspended in Mumbai rather than leaving me anxiously waiting for my luggage which never arrived. Spicejet staff could have been helpful and send my luggage to Cochin airport the same day. 5“Helpline” extremely Unhelpful at all times and never called me back for update. 6Finally when my luggage was sent to Cochin 3 very long and troublesome days later, my power bank was not in there. They could have easily put the power bank in the aircraft cabin. Spicejet said that they disposed of the power bank? My power was fairly new costed me £50 so surely someone is using it now.

The row in front of us kept their seats reclined back all through out. We pointed it out thrice before take off that the passengers need to follow the rules of straightening the seat back u during take off and landing. The cabin crew refused to ask the passengers to comply. Instead they asked my children to relocate to another seat that they said had more leg space. This is inexplicable. Since my daughter was having a tough time sitting in the seats that already have reduced leg space compared to other airlines, my 13 year daughter and 10 year son moved to seats 3A and 3B. Needless to say, these seats dis not have any extra leg space and the cabin crew was lying.

She gave one sandwich and 2 chicken options and asked me to pay 60 AED. I asked why and she said that only the seats are included. I was not carrying cash and my wife was not carrying her wallet. I gave her my card and she said they dont accept. When i asked her - first of all , you didnt tell me that this is chargeable and secondly, you never told me that you accept only cash.

Despite the long line, they were more interested in finding the tiniest fault possible and charging outrageous amounts as excess baggage. This was the first time that I had been asked to pay for an excess of 2kgs and Rupees 800 for the same.

With 2 tickets our checkin baggage was within the limit but because they added our hand baggage to Our checkin we were asked to pay extra- and they charge a hefty amount of 400Rs per kg.

Why have so many itineraries to select from while booking if you actually cannot run those? I called up the Customer Care and requested to change the flight to 5.40 PM which is available, just so that the risk of missing the connecting flight is less. But I was told about the policies and stuff that I have to pay the Ticket Fare + Change Penalty if I have to get it changed. Seriously guys!? is this what you call customer service? The flight is re-scheduled by 15 Min less than 2 Hrs which is the minimum time interval required for the ticket to be rescheduled free of cost according to ""Policy"".

I don’t usually do this but the reason for writing this review is manifold. Firstly, the delay in flight time owing to poor weather conditions, its hard to comprehend how other airlines can operate on time in similar conditions. I just hope the delay was not caused to the airline staff. Secondly, if flight is delayed then the same can be conveyed well in advance to avoid any inconvenience to a lady travelling with a toddler. Thirdly, this really tested my patience, the rude and indifferent behaviour of the lady at the counter at Coimbatore airport. She was not not considerate enough to check in the hand baggage meant for the baby and insisted that the same should be caaried in cabin. I wonder if its the AUW that counts and other airlines can consider, why same thing could not be replicated by the Spice jet. Overall, it was a nightmare and a horrible experience.

SpiceJet,9,"""experienced it overall as good""",P Torven,2nd December 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Colombo to Goa via Chennai. All flights were on time and the airplanes were very new. I had only hand luggage. They really check the weight, so make sure you only bring 7 kilos or take something out before they weigh it. They only provide you one cup of free water (maybe you can ask for more), but it was no problem to bring my own little bottle of water. When your luggage get checked at the airport, they don't throw the bottle away. For food you have to pay and it seemed like they have only factory fabricated kind of food. But this was also no problem, as my flights were very short. The flight attendants were young girls and they were friendly. I experienced it overall as good.",yes
SpiceJet,2,"""they are so inefficient""",Seana Harvey,2nd December 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Jaipur to Goa via Ahmedabad . Save your money and don’t fly with them. 4.5 hours turned into 8.5 hrs. More time was spent waiting than actually in air flying. No communication was given as we were herded like sheep from one security point to the next. Initially the flight was late 1.5 hours. We flew to Ahmedabad which was 55 minutes. The same plane flight was to continue on to Goa. However it didn’t. Everyone continuing on to Goa was asked to stay seated and present their ticket. Ten minutes later another passenger informed us we had to change planes. We exited to a bus which took us out of the airport then back in- through security once again then made to wait an additional 2.5 hours. Originally to be in Goa at 4:10pm actual arrival 8:30pm. Not to mention their staff is terrible, no smiles, compassion, communication. I was shocked at how little we were told about what was going on. I thought Spicejet was a reputable company but they are so inefficient it’s ridiculous. They did off meal vouchers for the inconvenience. I would have preferred a customer service agent that didn’t stare blankly and say he accepted the situation but would do nothing to resolve it.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""the worst experience""",S Buhmari,15th November 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Pune. I travelled SpiceJet for the first time & this was the worst experience as compared to other airlines. They are charging for checkin bag, you can carry only hand bag - if your carrying checkin bag you have to pay for that as per the weight. In SpiceJet the seat arrangements are very compact as compared to other airlines, you can't stretch your legs properly. There will be no complementary food, you have to pay for food. The crew & airport staff don't know how to treat the customers, they are very rude.",no
SpiceJet,2,"""the worst web site""",Vishal Tarolkar,15th November 2018,✅ Trip Verified |  Pune to Dubai. I would mention here that their Web Site is the worst web site of all I have so far dealt with. Its not reliable at all.

SpiceJet,5,"""Spicejet is a very cheap""",C Armand,15th November 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Delhi to Guwhati. Sat on my seat and saw a used spoon and a knife left there in the magazing holder. I asked the staff to take it away to which she replied leave it there, I'll take it later. Actually, you should have taken it away even before you started boarding. Spicejet is a very cheap and fast way to travel but I guess that does not mean you can drop your standards that low, leaving dirty cutlery from the last passengers for the new ones. I am still paying big bucks.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""It feels like hell""",Suhas Thambi Kareparambil,15th November 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to Cochin. Worst airline in the world. They charge all the cabin luggage. My cabin bag was 7kg when checking at home. SpiceJet says it is 7.4 kg, ask me to pay extra charge for 1 kg. Also they charge me extra for Duty free items purchased from airport. Safety belt hook was not working in my seat. Toilet are dirty and flush not working properly. Passage is too narrow, congested. Flight delay 40 minutes for take off without any reason. Delay of luggage on arrival. It feels like hell.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""Never recommend""",N Ison,15th November 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | New Delhi to Varanasi. Spicejet has turned out to be my worst flight experience till now. This is the only airline that thinks telling passengers about the flight delay is not necessary as they delay their flights daily. I was travelling to varanasi on 30/10/18 10.10 am flight and a had a same day return via IndiGo 6.30 pm flight. After reaching airport I got to know the flight is delayed by 3 hrs, I had received no message or email so I decided to postpone my trip to next day after paying 4k as penalty for rescheduling IndiGo to next day and guess what next - same story next day. Moral of the story is Spicejet sucks. Rating negative. Never recommend.",no
SpiceJet,6,"""improve on time performance""",P Gamesh,15th November 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Guwahati to Chennai. SpiceJet can hardly be relied upon for punctuality. The thing to be noticed is that it is in major routes and also that the delays are huge whenever they happen. So if one has a connecting flight, train or bus, one has to keep fingers crossed. Risky. The airline needs to improve on time performance.",no

Have no luggage at all, the counter sent me to ticketing and they just said that I have to buy a new ticket. Took the next flight after paying 5K for 9:50am and the gates to board haven’t opened at 9:45am. I have been warned by others that this is the worst of them all! Shame on you",no
SpiceJet,2,"""The very worst airline""",Kamlesh Pillai,15th November 2018,✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Mumbai. The very worst airline. They are calculating even the laptop weight also even though the flight is almost empty. I will consider not to use this airline in entire journey.,no
SpiceJet,2,"""never travel SpiceJet again""",Sachin Singh,15th November 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a return ticket Mumbai to Delhi and now on my return journey they are using me to pay Rs. 400 more because on my return ticket they have printed ""hand baggage fare only"". This is a sly underhand way of extracting money from their customers. How is it possible this was not printed on my ticket from BOM-DEL? They are blaming IRCTC for this and saying don't book through IRCTC. Why are they selling tickets through 3rd parties? I am never going to travel with SpiceJet again.",no
SpiceJet,2,"""you must pay for everything""",R Vincent,15th November 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Spicejet from Tirupati to Hyderabad as I travel for my holidays to SE Asia. Like many have said on this site, this is probably the worst Indian airline to travel with. In comparison with IndiGo or Vistara, nothing is free, you must pay for everything. The ticket price is not that cheap compared to other Indian airline, the story began when the flight was delayed for more than an hour without communication with us. After that, we boarded an old plane with nothing onboard - tight legroom, rude staff, A/C not working, toilet disgusting etc. Luckily, the flight was not that and was still able to made in to my flight at 10 pm to get on my flight to SE Asia via Dubai. My advice - don't travel on Spicejet if you can help. Try and fly another airline whenever possible.",no
Vistara,1,“I expect better”,Vinayak Mohan,28th August 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | I'm deeply disappointed with my recent experience with Vistara Airlines. My booking was unexpectedly canceled without my consent or any prior communication, allegedly due to a fraud alert from my bank. Despite my repeated requests for clarification and proof, Vistara has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation or address my concerns professionally. This lack of transparency and communication has caused significant inconvenience, both financially and in terms of time. A mere refund is not enough to compensate for the stress and trouble caused by this mishandling. I expect better from a reputed airline like Vistara, and I urge them to address such issues more responsibly in the future.",no

Some people lack basic etiquettes and cannot be trusted with hospitality spaces. But does the airline care? Of course not.",no

I am 6.2 feet height and still I was able to sit comfortably. They provided food also, after long time get food in Indian domestic flight was a good feel.

Vistara,6,“on-board experience is a bit so-so”,P Reddy,28th August 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | The on-ground experience was great, very pleasant check-in experience, the Adani lounge has a separate section for Vistara Frequent Fliers and Business Class which is quite nice. The on-board experience is a bit so-so, the legroom in economy is fairly tight and feels less than Indigo. They have cut-down on the quantity of food in meals visibly in economy class. The IFE was good enough to keep oneself entertained and thankfully with the middle seat remaining empty, the flight was quite comfortable.",yes
Vistara,7,"""onboard experience was amazing""",S Hunsel,28th August 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |  A late night flight (10 pm) delayed by almost 45 minutes is not the most pleasant beginning to the journey, especially given the horrible Encalm Lounge in Delhi (dirty, crowded, rubbish food). However, the onboard experience was amazing, the A321 has lie-flat seats with large IFE screens (which is a treat, since I could sleep comfortably for over an hour in a less than 2 hour flight). The cabin crew were prompt, helpful and very attentive. Upto 4 food choices and a pretty good spread. The IFE screens were great and the entertainment catalog is good enough for a short domestic flight but would be a bit boring for a 4-5 hour or above flight. However, baggage claim experience was not the best, despite the baggage being priority tagged it arrived after 60-65% of the co-passengers in the flight had received their bags, and when you are running over an hour late, it was a bit frustrating.",yes
Vistara,1,"""Extremely disappointed""",Kirti Dubey,28th August 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |  I faced a helpless situation with Vistara. No staff present, no proper guidance provided, and so much time wasted. Even after trying to contact the staff, I had to wait for an unbearably long time, and they were not at all helpful. If the management was better, I wouldn't have missed my flight even after reaching 50 minutes before. I would strongly advise anyone to choose another airline where at least you receive proper guidance and don't have to wait for staff to show up. Very disheartened by the airline; this was a very, very bad experience. Extremely disappointed with Vistara.",no

Vistara,7,“cabin crew were warm and efficient”,T Reddy,28th August 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | The flight from Bengaluru to Mumbai was on-time and pleasant. The cabin crew were warm and efficient, the legroom was comfortable, one is truly going to miss Vistara once it merges with Air India. If there are a couple of areas of concern, it would be the food, the quantity was generous but tasteless. The other area would be that in seat selection, if they can point out the restricted recline seats during seat selection.",yes

After my tray being taken away i had trash left and i pressed call button no-one came for 10 mins after that descent began and seatbelt signs were on and then lady arrives and askes me to close the tray.

Since I was genuinely uncomfortable I walked around the aircraft to check if any other seats available. I saw multiple empty seats in the premium economy and requested to move there. I was refused by cabin crew and then even after requesting the inflight supervisor my request was rejected. This used to be my favourite airline but just so put off by this behaviour.

It’s April 2, 2024 and I’m still at the airport to board another flight as I’ve never seen such an irresponsible set of staff. It was a day when many Vistara flights were delayed or either cancelled. When they were not onboarding even after 7pm, when we asked the officer at the gate, he informed that the flight is delayed and will take off by 11:30pm. Till we asked, no updates were given by the Vistara staffs. The flight status was showing “on time” and “security” even at 8pm. The flight arranged dinner for us and by 11:50pm, we were on-boarded to the flight. But the flight didn’t take off even at 12:30am on April 2, 2024. When checked with the cabin crew, they informed that the captain of the flight parked the flight and went away. Now only first officer is available. And they are waiting for another captain to come and take the flight. The cabin crew also has been waiting since 6pm on April 1, 2024. Then the first officer (very helpful and gentle man) informed us that by 1:15am he will inform us the decision of the flight is going or getting cancelled. By 1:30am we were informed the flight is rescheduled to 5am. When we asked for confirmation that f the flight, they said they cannot confirm until 4am. Only then they can know if any captain can come and fly the plane to Kochi. So they de-boarded us from the plane and we were sent to the arrival area to reclaim our baggage. In the flight we were informed if we need a refund, it will be done at the arrival. When we reached the arrival, we came to know that no such information is given to the arrival. So we strongly asked for a cancellation and confirmation on refund. They were not willing to give the confirmation. I said I need the confirmation of refund. Finally the staff at the arrival got a WhatsApp message of my PNR full refund confirmation. I booked another Indigo flight to Kochi at 10:10am and I’m at the airport since yesterday 6pm. Just now while typing this message, I got a call from Vistara that the flight which was supposed to leave at 5am did not go yet and now they are ready to fly to Kochi. I asked what was the purpose of the call? They informed me the flight is only left with 6 passengers (it was almost a full flight) and if we are willing, they are ready to take us. I said no. Had they properly updated all passengers from time to time, they could have avoided this issue and such a hat-redness towards this airlines. I was supposed to reach my home at 10:30pm yesterday. Who will take responsibility of the stress and strain I went through?",no

Two of the three suitcases were delivered to us after five days on February 20. The third suitcase was not delivered. On departure from Colombo on March 4th, I was informed at the Vistara counter that the suitcase was not found. While in Sri Lanka, they ignored all the emails sent asking about the luggage. The phone line is impossible to call. On the way back from Colombo to Munich, one of the three backpacks was not delivered again. Fortunately, they brought it home to us after a few days. However, the original baggage checked in on the way there remains lost. The airline does not respond at all to emails sent requesting compensation. Finally, they wrote yesterday: With reference to your email, we would like to inform you that as per the investigation the baggage was delivered to you. Hence, we are unable to assist you further. We again apologize for the delay of the baggage. We look forward to welcoming you on board in the future. Incredibly. Due to the approach to customers, I recommend avoiding this company.",no

Our flight was from Frankfurt by Mumbai to Colombo (and return). In way to Mumbai connection was relatively short (3h) and Vistara staff informed us that I don’t need to go to immigration (stay in transit) and is not necessary start execution of my Visa promise (ETA) which was valid to day of arrive to Mumbai.  After 2 weeks when we returned immigration office didn’t allowed us to leave the airport (connection was long – above 24 hours and Vistara not secured transit hotel). When Vistara staff was called from Immigration to offer service for customers staff of Vistara wanted to send us again to transit are promised us to arrange transit hotel, to organize meal, water etc. But procedure which used was clever, every 100-200 meters they sent us to another person, and last one – before secure control promised that up stairs will wait another Vistara representative who will help us. Upstairs was duty free area without any Vistara office/ desk. Without also possibility to return. We were left in the lurch and we lost our hotel reservation in Mumbai without any Vistara help, without any compensation. If are any problems not expect help and support from staff.

Finally, Vistara today accepted that they haven't processed it! all this took hell of follow-up e-mails, calls and so far no result.

The biggest surprise was the menu, an how delicious the different choices were done. Except from the nowadays still rubbery buns, we had Indian and Oriental menus with tastes, The only disappointment was that a plane as big as the 787 had to squeeze in a 3-3-3 arrangement in this class, when I expected 2-3-2.

The cabin crew, led by the remarkable team of Jibran, Nevil, and Anuradha, truly set Vistara apart as one of the best airlines in the industry. From the moment I stepped on board, the warmth and professionalism of the cabin crew were evident.

Vistara,1,"""the bassinet seats were already sold out""",Ishan Kumar,17th February 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |  Before booking the flight, I called customer care and asked whether we would be availed with the bassinet or not and we were informed that the bassinet seats are given to the parents on a first come first serve basis. Once check-in was enabled we were assigned with default seats and they were not next to the bassinet so we called the customer care again to confirm. We were instructed by the customer care person to not change the default allocated seats and asked us to reach 4 hours before departure time to the airport as bassinet seats can only be assigned to parents at the airport while boarding. So we did as instructed and reached Paris airport before 4 hours departure but to our surprise all the bassinet seats were already sold out. As per ground staff there are 2 bassinets in economy out of which one bassinet is taken by a parent and other seat next to bassinet is assigned to a lady travelling alone. Ground staff assured us that they will make a request to the lady and ask her to swap the seat with one of us so we can have the bassinet for our daughter. When boarding was about to start (same ground staff present who said they will make the request) we reminded again to the staff but as per them the lady was still not there so we were again asked to go ahead and they will make a request once she will board the flight and we again trusted them. Now once we boarded the flight , the crew in flight said they can not request someone to give their seats to us and it's no longer possible to have the bassinet seat. The best thing we found in this entire scenario is that none of the bassinet seats were assigned to parents. All those seats were sold to individuals (we were lied by the ground staff saying that its given to a parent but all three person sitting were individuals and not even travelling together as a family) who paid for extra leg space so my question is why are those seats called bassinet seats at all and you even say it to parents that those seats are designed for parents travelling with kids and can be only given to the parents on first come first basis when this is not at all followed by your staff or your system anywhere? We requested multiple times from the customer care to let us choose those seats beforehand and we were even ready to pay for the charge also? Even after doing this much followup a simple thing can not be done by your staff then am not sure how you are operating this big airline. We would have happily travelled with our daughter without bassinet if those seats were given to other parents with higher needs but those seats were assigned to individuals with no kids while others were just struggling with their kids.",no

The IFE was good, the food and drinks were good and the in-flight service was warm and professional. However, the check-in process was not as per expectations despite access to the priority check-in due to the loyalty program. The staff at the counters were taking a lot of time to check-in individual passengers in the priority lane. If I had to wait in the regular economy queue, I would have missed my flight. Separately a little disappointed that on a previous review of a sub-par experience on my flight from Male to Mumbai in Premium Economy, Vistara's ORM team commented asking for booking details, it has been 10 days since I responded on email and there has not even been an automated acknowledgement of the email forget any action and I have been a CV Gold member for a couple of years now. The ORM team's job cannot be just posting a templated message.",yes
Vistara,1,"""experience has left a lasting negative impression""",Kiran Subedi,28th November 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | My journey involved a flight from Bangalore to Delhi and a connecting flight from Delhi to Kathmandu on a premium economy of Vistara. Unfortunately, the initial flight from Bangalore experienced a half-hour delay, which caused concern as I had a tight connection in Delhi to catch my Vistara flight to Kathmandu. Upon arrival in Delhi, I immediately proceeded to the International transfer office to seek assistance. Regrettably, the Vistara staff informed me that I would not be able to catch my connecting flight. They mentioned they could provide an alternative, and I suggested two possible options: Royal Nepal Airlines A330 and Air India A319/20. However, the staff working there insisted that no alternatives were available and informed me that I had to stay in Delhi for a day. When I requested accommodation, the Vistara staff provided the name of a hotel called ""Saptagiri."" Concerned about the poor reviews of this hotel on Google Maps, I asked for a better alternative. I was directed to speak with a senior staff member who wore an Air India identity card. This individual was incredibly rude and unhelpful, insisting that I had no choice but to stay at the designated hotel. His behavior was both dominating and frustrating. Upon arriving at the suggested hotel, I found it to be in a deplorable condition, far worse than expected. To my shock, the hotel owner informed me that Vistara Airways had only allocated Rs. 400 per guest for food, which was wholly inadequate. I eventually managed to return via Vistara Air on the 17th, but this entire experience has left a lasting negative impression. I regret to say that I will no longer consider Vistara Airways for my future travels.",no
Vistara,6,"""disappointed on the return flight""",S Shetty,28th November 2023,"Not Verified |  After a fantastic flight from Mumbai to Male on Vistara Premium Economy, I was a bit disappointed on the return flight with the food and crew service. The crew was just not as attentive. The only choice offered was between a veg and non-veg meal. I opted for the non-veg option but the food was not very good, unfortunately I was super hungry by that time. The crew offered beer which was warm and had lost all its fizz. Boarding and onboarding experience were fine, seats quite comfy and the IFE has enough to keep you entertained. Hopefully Vistara standardises the softer parts of the on-board passenger experience to align with the good hard product.",yes
Vistara,9,"""overall a great experience""",S Shetty,28th November 2023,"Not Verified |  This was my first international flight with Vistara and overall a great experience. The crew was attentive, menus were offered with options of 4 main courses and even the drinks were refreshed on a short 2.5 hour flight. The Premium Economy seats are quite comfortable and offer lots of legroom. The Vistara IFE has also improved quite a bit and there are enough options to keep you entertained. Overall very impressed with the flight and would look forward to flying a longer international route with them in the future.",yes
Vistara,2,"""$70 for a slightly larger carry on""",M Walsh,28th November 2023,✅ Trip Verified |   They charged me $70 for having a slightly larger carry on from Cochin to Delhi. The customer service is slow and they are unprofessional in the way they handle extra charges.,no
Vistara,3,"""I was completely dissatisfied""",H Saunders,28th November 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I always judge a company on how they handle changes to normal procedure. Vistara 100% fails. I first tried to change my ticket to different date. I tried online and my booking disappeared. I called and was left on hold for over an hour before I gave up. I then tried to cancel my reservation. The service representative simply hung up on me. So, I used the ticket. The airline staff are some of the rudest people in the world. What happened to customer service? The flight was fine. The breakfast was inedible, except for the bread. For lunch there was a Thai dish offered but there was none left by the time the attendant got to me. I had some nonveg chicken dish. It was terrible. One hundred percent inedible. All in all I was completely dissatisfied with Vistara for this trip. A couple of important lessons I learned. First, there's no advantage in flying economy premium. Second, Vistara is fine if you have extremely low expectations and don't try to change anything or deal with customer service. In the future, every time I see the advertisement that Vistara is the best airline in India, I'll probably laugh out loud.",no
Vistara,10,"""She was extremely hospitable""",Scott Francis,28th November 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was on a Vistara flight UK874 from HYD to BOM, and one air hostess Jugnu has been one of the most kindest and genuine air hostess I’ve come across.

Vistara,4,"""expect better from a reputed airline""",Nisha Jain,25th September 2023,✅ Trip Verified |  They make sure all the seats are under the charged category where you get no option to choose your seats except all the middle seats. With the family of four that option wasn’t feasible. In fact they auto selected the last row which has no Legroom and no recline. It was a tortuous journey where front seat reclines to the max and we have no place to breathe. Why don’t respective authorities seat and experience what oft feels to travel on the last seat. The fact well known than why sell these seats. We expect better from a reputed airline.,no

Vistara,1,"""Terrible service customer service""",K Singh,25th September 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Stay away pay extra and book a more reputable flight airway. Terrible service customer service is a borderline comedy act with no real acceptance of the poor experience on the customer's end. What to expect from Vistara: delayed baggage (by 3 hours) on arrival and then a staff member threatening to remove you from the airline for having a piece of slightly overweight baggage without any form of assistance or actually providing a solution. Then on top of that the pure ridicule of the customer service we've had to deal with after is what you get from Vistara. I implore you after reading this review to please use another service and be better off, it may cost more but for your own sanity, health and wellbeing choose another airline.",no
Vistara,8,"""Onboard service was outstanding""",Rajan Parrikar,25th September 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Goa Dabolim to Mumbai in Business Class. Our aircraft was equipped with comfortable flatbed seats for the short flight. Onboard service was outstanding. However it took almost an hour for our bags to be loaded onto the carousel. While such delays may be out of the airline's control, the fact that there was neither an announcement nor any staff available to update status reflects poorly on Vistara. Instead of giving a full 10 rating, I will deduct a couple of points for this reason.",yes

Since then I have passed on all the documents and information at least 10 times to Vistara via direct email, twitter. They initially insisted we hadn't been charged the second time, but I have bank statements to prove we have then they said that we were not entitled to a refund as we took the flights, we know we did, but we paid twice for them Vistara.

For example even though it was barely an 1.30 hour journey a whole lunch meal was provided which was of the highest quality and taste and further my grandmother request of fasting which resulted to her being unable to eat the meal provided was dealt in a very wonderful and professional manner with the crew even providing fruits and juice instead. The actual flight was also very smooth and pleasant and there were no delays and we made it on time.",yes
Vistara,7,"""neat & tidy cabin""",V Ranganathan,14th August 2023,"Not Verified | Vistara is India's only FSC which offers premium economy seats on selected domestic routes. Recently I flew on Vistara from Coimbatore to Mumbai, my observation is they have neat & tidy cabin, some staffs had smiling face and some don't have any cheer in their face, food was below average, lavatories were clean, IFE can be used in personal devices and was great. Overall a good flight, except that the food taste and selection has to be improved. Soon this airline is going to be merged with Air India, hence hope things will change in the long run.",yes
Vistara,1,"""customer retention is not a priority""",M Allam,14th August 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | International Travelers flying to India with a Domestic connecting flight beware of the misleading luggage allowance and terrible customer service of this Airline. Flew into Mumbai, on a long and exhausting international flight. (Those of you that make these long haul journeys know exactly how I feel) Was booked on a connecting flight to Bengaluru. The check in at Mumbai Airport started with the Business Class and Premium Economy check in counters being roped off. I had to wait to be noticed to be let in. International flights let you check in two bags with a weight allowance of fifty pounds each. International connecting travellers are given the same allowance provided their connecting flight is within forty eight hours of the initial journey for the Domestic sector. I was charged nine thousand rupees extra baggage fees for a two and and a half thousand rupee flight. I asked for the Station Manager was told there are four of them assigned but unavailable. I was not the only victim of this extra baggage fee scam, there were several other international travellers that were facing this unfair extortion. My first service experience with this Airline has been incompetent, unpleasant, unaccommodating and rude, which I was forced to pay extra for. Not something any tired long haul International traveler should have to experience, least of all pay extra for. I sincerely hope that my sharing this unfortunate experience helps you avoid it. Fair, accommodating, competent customer service, ""brand loyalty"" or ""customer retention"" is not a priority here.",no

Onboard service was excellent and the overall flight experience was pleasant.",yes
Vistara,8,"""Overall a fantastic experience""",S Shetty,14th August 2023,"Not Verified |  Overall a fantastic experience with Vistara though the flight was delayed by half hour. The check-in was smooth and quick, the in-air experience was fantastic, there was a wide selection of meals and desserts on offer. The Vistara A321 is perhaps the only flight in which you can experience lie flat seats and a nice big IFE screen in domestic flights within India. The service was prompt and pleasant. Just a few things which could add to the experience - a wider selection of content would be needed for international routes, the content on offer was great for a domestic hop but thin in case the same selection is offered for an international flight. The Encalm lounge in Delhi is a improvement over the previous lounge but still not comparable to the one in Mumbai. I ended up leaving immediately and preferred to use the Amex Lounge over this.",yes
Vistara,1,"""Worst experience""",Swathi Ramachandran,14th August 2023,"Not Verified |  Worst experience and that’s with a premium ticket, don’t ever fly with Vistara, they lost my luggage and no updates since 3 days now. They are really useless, inefficient staff working and least bothered. The transit experience from Mumbai was total chaos.",no
Vistara,5,"""happy to be back in the air""",S Harashina,14th August 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vistara has for some time been the benchmark in Indian aviation with amazing service and attentive staff. Unfortunately due to personal issues, I was unable to fly for the last 4 months of so and was happy to be back in the air for a trip to Delhi on Vistara. I blocked the first row of economy class since the fare difference between economy and premium economy was quite high for the travel date. While the ground experience remains consistently good pre and post boarding. the in-air experience in economy has been quite degraded. For a morning 6 am flight, Vistara did not offer tea/coffee in economy class. The breakfast was very poor and my omelette was inedible. No condiments except a small roll and butter on offer.  Now coming to the Club Vistara program. I called up Vistara, 2 weeks prior to my flight, as I had 2 Upgrade vouchers and wanted to use one and asked them to recommend a flight on which I could use my upgrade voucher (any flight and ok with either Eco to Prem Eco or Prem Eco to Business) and I was told that no upgrades available even 2 weeks before flying. Imagine my surprise that i could see at least 2-3 empty seats in premium economy in the flight i was traveling in.",yes
Vistara,1,"""utterly awful experience""",Glen George,14th August 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | It was an utterly awful experience from start to finish. I fly this route a lot, usually with Emirates or Qatar and had read some good things so thought I’d try out Vistara business class. The fun started at boarding in Dhaka where there was no business priority and an approx. hour queue to clear security in to the gate where three separate flights were taking off from. Dhaka is an old airport with security at the gates but other airlines manage it just fine. There was only one Vistara employee checking boarding cards and when I asked him about Business priority and told him I would miss the flight he just shrugged and walked off. I only made the flight by taking my life in my hands and queue jumping, nearly causing a riot in the process. The flight Dhaka to Delhi is Premium economy not business - the seat is even labelled as such. Transfer at Delhi very odd - despite having a boarding pass I was escorted to the transfer desk to be given another one. I couldn’t access the WiFi as I hadn’t been sent the code I apparently needed (and no one on board has any). And then having paid $20 for it; it cut off halfway through (despite being advertised as ‘whole flight’) and I had to pay again! And then to cap it off, on arrival at Heathrow the business class bags came off last rather than first, which felt like a good summation of the whole experience. Never again.",no

Vistara,1,"""better options are available""",Abhijit Banerjee,14th June 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Not what is expected of a full-service airline that isn't cheap.

I panicked to find my phone everywhere which was noted by one of the Vistara airport staff named tabasshum who without any questions helped us look for our phone. Another of the airport staff member Suhaib also helped us a lot to find our phone. Both of these members helped us incredibly and sent us our phone back to Mumbai within 24hrs. They were constantly in touch with us till we got our phone and helped us with all the formalities procedures to get the phone.

They serve well, the food options are top notch and the announcements loud and clear. There is plenty of leg space and the seats are comfortable. The ground are very supportive and help out whenever necessary. I had an international transfer with a transit window of less than an hour in a huge airport.

After their confirmation regarding the extra baggage added in the PNR, they didn't allow me to board without charge of extra luggage. It was a hot discussion at the Ahmedabad airport and they treated me with totally rude behaviour and wasted 3 hours at the airport. They don't know the meaning of humbleness and the fact came out that there is not synchronization between their team. Customer team response totally disagreed by their airport team. Since last 35 days, I'm sending chasers to them but received 2 emails that to with incomplete information and denied to give the refund. Worst experience I have ever had in my life for this flight. Highly not recommended. I'm ready to share the further proof if there is a need.",no

Not only was the entire journey comfortable with the smoothest landing but I want to especially highlight the service at the checkin counter at Mumbai T2 airport. I'd got the flight timings mixed up and there was a delay at my end admittedly, panic ensued but the staff at Mumbai airport were patient and managed to allow me to board the flight to Kochi. Words can't express my gratitude to Yash, Dolly and especially Sohail sir - a man of few words but your kindness left a huge impact on me. In a sea of horror stories of domestic Indian flights, I want to thank the staff of Vistara for setting an example and keeping the customer at the heart of what you do.

Vistara,4,"""extra for Premium is not really worth it""",W Hasara,14th June 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  The seats in the premium economy are in 3-3-3 arrangements compared to the 3-2-3 in the older version of the aircraft. The seat space is similar to the economy with a little more leg space. Paying extra for the Premium is not really worth it. Sometimes the premium economy seats are cheaper only go for it, when this option is available. No wifi on-board on this aircraft, TV sets can't be tilted. If the person sitting in front of you reclines his/her seat you can switch off your screen and plan something else to do.

Our flight from Srinagar to Delhi departed at 16.00hrs and landed at 17.30hrs by the time the aircraft could dock the bay area it was 17.50hrs. Even though Delhi airport is huge we managed to get to the security gate and got through security at 18.15hrs. Even though we knew we were getting delayed for our next flight ran to the boarding gate which was also quite far from the security area . When we reached there it was 18.30hrs and boarding gates were closed. I am well aware that once boarding gates are closed they aren't opened but since it was their flight which was delayed they and since we had already crossed security check they should have given us a call which wasn't done.

Vistara,2,"""Vistara is seriously lacking""",A Rahman,11th April 2023,"Not Verified | We were planning to fly on Premium Economy from Kolkata to Udaipur via Delhi. Due to delays on Vistara, the flight did not land in time to make the connecting flight to Udaipur - even though we were assured on the flight over to Delhi by the staff onboard that since the delay was about 40 min, the connecting flight would wait for the 20 passengers to Udaipur. At Delhi airport, the Vistara ground staff told us that the connecting flight had departed and that they were trying to figure out what to do. We were asked to reclaim our suitcases in Delhi and told that we would be booked on an Indigo flight that was due to leave in 3 hours time. No other information was provided for almost 2 hours, and we were repeatedly told when enquiring that the ""seniors officers"", who did not appear once in front of us were working on the issue. With less than 1 hour to go, we were handed printed paper tickets on 8x11 sheets with random passenger's barcodes on both side of the sheets of paper and told to make our way to Terminal 1. We now had to pair up with random passengers and travel together so that we could go through security at the other terminal. Nobody escorted. the group of 20 to Terminal 1, which is 20+ minutes by a shuttle bus that weaves through the city traffic to Terminal 1 from Terminal 3. We got to terminal 1 with 2 minutes before they closed baggage intake. As a premium economy passenger, the baggage allowance is 30 Kg on Vistara, and we were assured by the ground staff that the baggage allowance would be honored as Vistara had called ahead to Indigo. To our surprise, Indigo told us that no such calls were placed and that we had to pay for any excess baggage above the standard 15 Kgs. We had to shell out INR 8250 (over $100) for excess baggage just so that we could get on the flight. When I called Vistara to rectify the situation, I was placed on hold for 25 min and eventually the line was cut off. On the 2nd call, after a 15 minute conversation I was told that they could not do anything for me and that I have to return to the Vistara counter where the Indigo ticket was issued to argue my case in Delhi. When I asked to speak to a ""senior"", I was told that they would reach out to me in 1 to 2 hours. The calls never came. I am thoroughly disappointed with the service. My attempts to rectify the situation with Vistara was essentially ignored. While in-flight service is good, when things go wrong and when service and understanding is needed the most, Vistara is seriously lacking.",no

Flight got cancelled in previous day due to technical snag and i could not notice the message send. I have reached the boarding gates and then realized and staff informed me that no seats on next Delhi flights and full refund for the ticket can be made. Found that all other airline flights also going full. Airline staff offered later 9.45am flight, which will not meet my requirement. While i was trying to find a solution to reach Delhi at early, suddenly met Mr Vinod came out with idea of trying on 8am flight of Vistara as a standby and made me wait till gate closing time then board the flight. It was a great great relief. I should thank Vistara team for such wonderful support and especially Mr Vinod George. Vistara is one of the great airlines and wish them all the Best.",yes
Vistara,6,"""cabin crew were courteous""",Rahul Anand,19th January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  I didn't have check in baggage so no check in experience. Boarding experience was  totally mismanaged, no queue, no sequential boarding. Seats are better that LCC. Working IFE system and had good collection of movies. Meal served was good, cabin crew were courteous. Departed on little late and reached Delhi 15 min late. Overall mix experience.",yes
Vistara,10,"""totally loved the flight service""",S Alabramian,19th January 2023,✅ Trip Verified |  Service was amazing. Experienced business class service even in the economy class.

Vistara,3,"""ground staff is so rude and ignorant""",Manu Anand,19th January 2023,Not Verified | You cannot label front economy seats as Premium Economy. These are 3:3:3 layout Economy seats with no additional comfort. You just cannot change the global definition of any class for your profits. Route: FRA to DEL. On top of this your ground staff is so rude and ignorant that they won’t accommodate any requests no matter how serious.,no
Vistara,10,"""Another flawless flight""",Rajan Parrikar,19th January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Another flawless flight from Goa to Bombay in Business Class. Vistara does everything right for the premium class, from check-in to boarding to inflight service. I rate it as the best full-service domestic airline currently operating in India. The experience could be enhanced further by offering WiFi in the aircraft.",yes
Vistara,10,"""the finest premium experience""",Rajan Parrikar,19th January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bombay to Goa in Business Class in an A320. Vistara currently provides the finest premium experience in India. The entire experience was flawless. Comfortable seats, warm service. There is no WiFi on this route but given the short flight time it is not an issue.",yes
Vistara,2,"""experience was extremely disappointing""",G Marler,19th January 2023,✅ Trip Verified |  The worst airline I have ever flown with. I booked and paid a premium for seating in row seven. Online check in allocated the three of us row 25. I emailed Vistara three days prior to our departure explaining that when checking in online we had been allocated the incorrect seats. No response was received. Airport check in staff either couldn’t or wouldn’t correct the obvious error and didn't seem care even though one person in our group had mobility issues. There response was that they were only responsible for checking in and it wasn’t their problem. So now I have to fill out paperwork to claim a refund for the seating I booked and paid for which was allocated to someone else. Also the people in row 24 were totally ignorant of normal polite inflight protocol and reclined their seats which affected the person in our group with the mobility issue. We asked them to be not recline their seats but all to no avail. Eventually after a vocal exchange with these people a flight attendant moved them to different seats. The whole experience was extremely disappointing and very unprofessional.,no
Vistara,8,"""Good experience""",Rahul Anand,19th January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience of early morning flight, smooth on time boarding. Seats are ok, better than LCC in India, staff were courteous. God breakfast served along with tea/coffee, arrived on time.",yes
Vistara,4,"""return flight was considerably better""",Carl Pinto,4th October 2022,"Not Verified | Mumbai to Singapore a mediocre experience. Vistara doesn't have early bag drop in Mumbai. When I landed in Singapore, I found that two wheels of my suitcase were damaged. Vistara's rep said that wear and tear would not be compensated, which I accepted. The repair man I took it to noticed a large gash on body, and said I should replace the bag. On both sectors my food quality and quantity were lacking. Outbound sector was an overnight flight at 0145hrs, Breakfast comprised of an omelette, chicken sausage, and something else. Return lunch was a bowl of curry with chicken,  vegetable and rice. A salad started the meal and a small rasmalai for dessert. Lie flat seats in a 2x2 layout in the narrow body aircraft, with little privacy. There's not much time to sleep so its not a major issue. I wasn't impressed by the crew on the outgoing flight, perhaps because of the time of day. I felt that they were trying to rush things, but the return flight was considerably better. Internet on board voucher given did not work.",no

Vistara,8,"""Service was good""",Rahul Anand,4th October 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Currently only Vistara offers premium economy in Indian domestic sector. Price is slightly above economy but worth for that. 1st 4 rows after business class is premium economy, seat pitch are good, comfortable than any airline except business class. Priority check in and boarding for premium economy passengers. First they served cold towels which was a pleasant starting. Though it doesn't Matter much but they shared a menu for the flight.

Vistara,8,"""the experience was amazing""",Advay Biswal,4th October 2022,"Not Verified |  This is not the first time I have flown Vistara, and the experience was amazing. The Check-In was pretty quick. On board service was excellent and the staff was polite. The flight was on time. In spite of a short flight, they still served good snacks.

Vistara,9,"""I would definitely recommend it""",A Kamath,4th October 2022,"Not Verified |  I would definitely recommend it. The staff are very polite and speak excellent Hindi and English. Some innovative ways to introduce safety announcements before the flight. The food is delicious and authentic.  There is plenty of entertainment from both Hollywood and Bollywood as well. The only thing I would improve is that for tall people like myself, there isn't a lot of leg room. Otherwise, everything is excellent.",yes

Vistara,5,"""Not a good experience""",Rahul Anand,4th October 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding process at Ahmedabad was total disaster, the ground staff didn't had any clue what they are doing. There were total chaos, business, premium economy and economy ,no one knows where to be in queue, even after complaining the staff were not accepting their mistakes. My snack provided in flight was stale, when complained to cabin staff they just ignored and with few passengers they were rude too. Not a good experience.",no
Vistara,9,"""A really professional service""",I Thardatha,4th August 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently flew Vistara business class from Kolkata to Delhi, connecting to my international flight on Air Canada to Boston. The whole experience was positive. The check in process was smooth. My luggage was checked all the way to Boston without any fuss. The lounge in Kolkata was quite good. The plane left on time. The service on board was excellent. The staff took care to make sure I was comfortable. The meal service for such a short flight was very good. A really professional service all around. I will fly them again.",yes
Vistara,2,"""had to shift weight from my hand baggage""",N Bajisan,4th August 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  My ticket was with Air France and Air France uses Vistara as a codeshare partner for the flight from COK to DEL. Air Vistara doesn't honour weight limitations. I ended up paying 150$ as against stated policy of 100$ for baggage up to 32 KGs. I had to shift weight from my hand baggage as Vistara only allowed 7 Kgs vs 12KGs that allowed by Air France. It was a very disappointing experience to start an international trip like this. Would not recommend Vistara for travel within India.,no
Vistara,6,"""soft product was found to be wanting""",Joseph Sebastian,4th August 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I cannot fault the hard product, modern clean and well maintained aircraft but the soft product was found to be wanting. The crew seemed to go about their job in a robotic nature, no smile, no pleasantries, and the service was very disjointed. The food was a big let down and expected much better. It was bland, poor quality and mine was inedible.",yes
Vistara,10,"""a very pleasant experience""",Hem Desai,4th August 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very punctual on time flight even though we departed almost 15-20 minutes late due to previous flight from our gate departed very late. The boarding of more than 100 pax was completed in almost 20 minutes which is in my opinion very efficient. Inflight service was very good with good quality of food with both veg and non veg option which is included in the fare. Condition of the cabin, seat and overall aircraft was up to date. The inflight entertainment was also good. Overall a very pleasant experience flying with Vistara.",yes

Vistara,1,"""don't travel on Vistara""",N Hardy,4th August 2022,✅ Trip Verified | London to Kochi via Delhi. Unless you have money to waste or want to be treated like a freeloader don't travel on Vistara. The staff both on ground and in flight treat the passengers like they are travelling for free. There is absolutely no respect given. On top of this the operations are terrible to say the least. The gates at Heathrow were announced 15 minutes before the gates closed. Considering the size of the airport it was highly inconvenient. The flights neither take of nor land in time. Our fight was supposed to depart from Delhi airport at 15:55 as per their boarding pass. But they called us to check our baggage for something at around 1545 even though the luggage was cleared at Heathrow airport and Delhi customs. They made us wait for absolutely no reason for almost half an hour. We had to run back to the boarding gate so that we don't miss our flight. For the price we pay the service is pathetic to say the least. The staff who are hardly exist around the airport are so arrogant and rude. I would rather walk for a day or 2 than fly in a one hour flight of Vistara.,no
Vistara,2,"""It was a joke""",Amit Baboo,4th August 2022,"Not Verified | Delhi to Ahmedabad. I was flying back from US on Lufthansa and had connection of Vistara from Delhi to Ahmedabad. Everything seemed perfect, the staff was helping and aircraft was superb, but when my luggage arrived my two wheels of my Samsonite bag were damaged. One was damaged and the other one was totally missing, the staff at airport was so polite and offer me charges of Rs150. It was a joke. Everyone knows how much full size Samsonite bag costs. It was better if they denied to pay. I had a flight of 30 hrs and was so tired that I left the airport after giving a very good smile to airport staff. Didn’t expected this from TATA.",yes
Vistara,2,"""I am dreading my flight back to London""",Namrata Malhotra,4th August 2022,"Not Verified |  I flew Vistara for the first time internationally. My experience right from conversations with customer service in London until my arrival in Poona suggests that there is a serious culture problem with the airline. I tried to check in online 5 times and called customer service for assistance. It was clear that the online check in needs more sophistication so I politely asked if they would take feedback to help improve it. The response was “no one has ever had such a problem”. The tone and response smacked of apathy and lack of professionalism. I have wide ranging experience with many airlines and customer service but haven’t experienced this as far as I can remember. On the plane, the stewardesses were robotic and cold, not to mention uninformed. The flight was late taking off from London. Thinking ahead about my connecting flight I asked if we could have the customs forms. These girls did not understand what I was asking and when I explained again they said there was no such form required. Arriving in Delhi, there was no ground staff to assist many of us who had connecting flights. To top it, many us who had priority and transfer tags in our bags waited 55 minutes for our bags. There was no ground staff to help. All of us missed our connecting flight due to the bags being egregiously delayed. I arrived in Pune in 24 hours. Vistara how can you compete in today’s customer centric world with such an apathetic attitude and deplorable service. I am dreading my flight back to London. Never again will I fly Vistara.",no
Vistara,1,"""accidentally booked 15 kgs of extra Luggage""",Madrid Vetticad,4th August 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Had a bad pre-flight experience with the airline, I had accidentally booked 15 kgs of extra Luggage instead of 10 KG. I contacted Vistara customer care to reduce my extra Luggage to 10 KG and refund the rest as airline points so as that I can use it in my return flight to Delhi after a month. I offered to make an additional 10kg purchase of luggage along with this carryover 5KG right away, but they refused to help me out. These requests were made 6 hrs prior to my first flight here from Auckland.",no
Vistara,10,"""Fly with Vistara, they are the best""",Kuldeep Singh,4th August 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I didn't expect anything else or special from Vistara. In fact I was a little apprehensive as I had never heard of them before, but I should not have. My experience was made good by the generosity and kindness of the crew. Nothing was too much of a trouble. Despite the fact that they work so hard to look after so many passengers the smiles and pleasantries never stopped. My row of economy class passengers from London to Delhi (UK0018) was looked after by Rajeev and Tanya. Such genuine, polite and hard working people. She was a lovely host and probably the best airline crew I came across in a long while. ""Thank you Rajeev and Tanya"" and rest of the team. Fly with Vistara, they are the best, a very human and pleasant experience.",yes
Vistara,10,"""I loved the experience flying Vistara""",Amanpreet Chander,5th June 2022,Not Verified |  I loved the experience flying Vistara. I was really happy to get the breakfast and the amazing service by the crew. Vistara has taken full care of your entertainment as they have provided onboard wifi service. I would like to thank Mr. Priya Ranjan and other crew members for their amazing service.,yes
Vistara,10,"""Got me to the check in counter in time""",Kavitha Valeriparambath,5th June 2022,Not Verified |  Flight was delayed due to weather conditions I had a connecting flight to Melbourne with in 2 hours of arrival at Delhi.

Vistara,6,"""interested in blame deflection""",N Teck,5th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  When things go well with this airline, you get a value-for-money and pretty comfortable experience while getting to wherever you're going. The hard product is  pretty good (newish aircraft, and good seat options esp. on the A321neo) and the flight and cabin crew are easily among the best I've flown with so far. When things fall apart, such as technical issues, Ground Ops at DEL is unable to plan ahead or communicate effectively. Despite having the three hours the flight was delayed to start making plans and arrangements, while 2 men worked, the other 3 men at the DEL transfer desk were either folding their arms or looking concerned, refusing to answer any questions while a dozen or so pax from a severely delayed incoming flight are either rushing for their connection or were simply brushed away without being given the basic accommodation.  Customer Care is only interested in blame deflection rather than feedback, repeating statements about technical issues and safety when the feedback was not about the technical delay at all.",no
Vistara,3,"""Very poor website for check-in""",Manickam Jayamurthy,5th June 2022,✅ Trip Verified | Very poor website for check-in. Allowed one passenger for check-in but the other passenger was not allowed. The e-ticket number is the same. Still a problem. Not a user friendly website. No help from the customer care except telling us to go to the check in desk.,no
Vistara,10,"""very helpful and informative""",Nitin John,5th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Hyderabad. I had too much additional luggage with me and was really worried about carrying it to the final destination, but staff were very helpful and informative.

This girl really help a lot to get it clear.",yes
Vistara,8,"""service was excellent and consistent""",V Ladhani,5th June 2022,"Not Verified |  I've flown this airline in same class before and knew what I can expect. Happy to notice that airline has hold it's standard and imparts superior product among all Indian and many EU carriers. Service excellence, catering and safety are few important points I noticed, where Vistara really plays the ball well. On both the sectors, service was excellent and consistent as well as catering. The entire cabin crew are eager at work and does all they could to serve the best. Polite, courteous, warm-heart, smartly dressed and professional crew reflecting Indian culture! The catering is among the best. Do not miss the desserts.  A catch I noticed is AVOD should be updated with new movies and series urgently. The selection has to be more vivid, broader and up-to-date. After one flight, one can easily run out of options. While on-board product is excellent, where Vistara can really improve is ground customer service. Now for the third time, I got differing information in comparison to representatives on airport. The ground staff is divided on procedures and info. This can be make or break deal because it's not reliable.  Cabin crew should keep up the excellent work. A superior product does cost a little more but Vistara is doing it's best and she does reflect her heritage inherited from elder sister in Singapore.",yes
Vistara,5,"""crew members are amazingly well mannered""",N Savina,5th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a flight today at 6:50pm from Bangalore to Delhi and reached the boarding pass counter after long queue outside the airport and managed to be there by 5:51 pm. I had boarding pass in my hand just wanted to submit my luggage. I asked 3 staff member of Vistara team if I am too late and every one said Mam you will catch the flight. But one staff was rude, he just didn’t want to even listen. Clearly telling me you can’t means can’t and I literally begged them and made them understood if I leave my luggage and rush to the gate I will be able to catch the flight. But it was clear that even if your staff was trying he simply wanted to be rude. I begged every staff member who were kind enough and have a logical reply to rush to the gate and leave my luggage and by 6:25 I was in the aircraft and even after me 3 more people boarded. Your crew members are amazingly well mannered but that guy wasn’t.  rest of the staff was super kind . Thanks",yes
Vistara,8,"""Flight was good and staff excellent""",P Brar,5th June 2022,Not Verified |  We flew premium economy and this was our first flight with Vistara. Flight was good and staff excellent. Having paid a little extra for premium economy I expected to give a glass of prosecco or champagne but received a small glass of water or orange. The airline tends to serve food and drink at the same time instead of drinks first but you had to ask for a second drink. Seats are comfortable. Biggest let down is they do not offer a choice of food for coeliac (gluten free). Fortunately we had contacted the airline and we took our own food but the staff on the flight did their best to find something for my wife. Ground staff don't care if your luggage has priority and on arriving at Heathrow although ours was marked priority it was one of the last ones out. Overall flight was good but waiting for luggage at Heathrow not good.,yes

Could gather their names are Ronali and Reena. Service with a smile, lots of patience, helping me out i while I had to transfer my pastry cutlery from cabin to checked baggage as I struggled to rush forward to the ongoing flight was a big help. Keep it up ladies. I remain a Vistara loyal flier. Only issue is that inflight food quality has gone down. Hope you can do something about that. Do give a big thanks to your ladies mentioned here.",yes

Inflight entertainment is provided through wifi, connect to flight wifi which can be used to open Vistara on flight entertainment website on individual devices. Overall good experience.",yes
Vistara,3,"""avoid booking their B737""",Rahul Anand,1st April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | Bad experience, booked for Premium Economy and at the last moment they changed to Economy with excuse that aircraft has been changed and no premium economy in that aircraft, also during call they said that now we have window and middle seats in mid row but at the last moment when we were doing web checking come to know that we both were given middle seats (so certainly on different rows). The app is pathetic, tried many times to change but unsuccessful, finally was able to do using laptop. Call centre is another bad experience, too long waiting time, also didn't get any confirmation mail about change from premium economy to economy, only refund was done on time. Even the aircraft was too cramped, very small leg space with respect to other Vistara aircraft, just like any LCC whereas Vistara is a full fledged carrier, my suggestion is to avoid booking their B737, their A320/321 are good. Food was ok for such a short route which was just 1 hour 30 min.",no
Vistara,10,"""professional and welcoming""",Davinder Nahar,1st April 2022,Not Verified |  I am satisfied with their service. They were really friendly and understanding and much better than other cabin crews they were professional and welcoming.

Vistara,9,"""onboard experience for these short flights is top notch""",Rajan Parrikar,1st April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | Goa to Bombay in an A320neo in Business Class. Vitara's onboard experience for these short flights is top notch. Good seats, good service, good snacks. My one complaint is the choice of music in flight: India is a land with a great musical tradition and instead of featuring an Indian music selection, Vistara for some reason has decided to go with bad Western music. Also - when is Vistara going to provide inflight wifi?",yes
Vistara,1,"""Customer service is pathetic""",Divakar Prasad,1st April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | Delhi to Varanasi. Customer service is pathetic. I have a ticket raised nearly a month ago regarding refund of extra luggage. This has not been replied by the customer relations people. The flight was cancelled at least a week before the flight date. At the time of booking the ticket from Delhi to Varanasi, I had booked extra luggage as I was travelling from overseas. For this refund I had raised a request. I sent several emails to the Indian customer relations people and having failed to get a reply I forwarded the e-mail to the Sydney office. I did get a reply from Sydney office who threw their hands in air, informing me that I need to follow up with the office in India - the headquarters - probably equally frustrated as I am. Due to all this saga, they lost the business to Air India - the same Airline that they have acquired. I hope they can provide the same service as Air India if not better - and I doubt it. I have used their service once and my review for other items is based on that.",no
Vistara,2,"""no welcome Champagne""",F Mazet-Mulye,1st April 2022,"Not Verified | The check-in was a very long queue. The Air France lounge was very nice. Onboard no welcome Champagne. Aperif none. Drinks with the food were two mediocre wine bottles were ushered, one Côte du Rhone and the other was a bad Chilean wine. Our dinner was mediocre if not worse. The seats are  bad, the legs are in a very narrow tunnel which makes it impossible to turn your feet/legs. We could not sleep more that 2 hours;. Then we were in transit in Delhi to catch the Vistara flight to Bombay. No Vistara lounge available and we had 4.30hrs transit time. We will never fly Vistara again in our life.",no

Vistara,9,""" on-board experience is top notch""",Rajan Parrikar,1st April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  The check-in process was a downer. The staff didn't seem enthusiastic. For a Business Class desk this is doubly strange. Vistara is currently the finest full service airline in India and the on-board experience is top notch. The seating is comfortable for short-haul, the service warm, and the snacks served outstanding. When is Vistara going to start offering inflight WiFi ?",yes
Vistara,10,"""These little gestures make the world just a bit more livable""",Yashika Sahdev,1st April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | It takes a lot for me to find a website to put my experience with a particular airline into a paragraph or two. However, when I had a distasteful experience with Indigo Airlines on my way to a Bagdogra and when the reason of my disappointment was absolutely reversed by Vistara Airlines, I had to take out time to write this review. My luggage bag's wheel went missing due to mishandling by the Indigo airline staff. I normally don't have the patience to drain my energy in fighting, Therefore, I received my luggage and left the airport. What came as a pleasant surprise was that I when I boarded my Vistara flight on my way back, carrying the same luggage bag with missing wheel, Vistara, despite taking a written note from me during checking in, of the damaged luggage bag, assumed that the luggage bag could have been damaged by them, fixed it with a new wheel. When I got my bag with the fixed wheel I knew I had to put this review to thank them. These little gestures make the world just a bit more livable.",yes

Vistara,9,"""flight was excellent""",V Reddy,26th November 2021,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Mumbai, flight was excellent. Dreamliner flight. The staff, the cabin crew were good. But I feel the flight from Mumbai to Chennai was not up to the mark. Not faced any issue but I feel it's not as standardised as the international London to Mumbai flight. The food was amazing and overall I love Vistara more than BA.",yes
Vistara,2,"""asked me to book a new ticket""",N Mardala,26th November 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights are new, clean & crew members are wearing Covid-19 PPE kit. I & my wife had Vistara tickets in the same flight segments. I booked my India portion of the ticket online through Vistara website. But my wife’s ticket was booked through a different agent. On Oct 3rd, we arrived at Baggage drop-off ticketing counter at at 6:05AM. Our flight departure was scheduled for 7:00AM. At the Baggage drop counter, they didn’t accept my baggage & but took my wife’s luggage & placed in the weighing machine. The agent in the counter informed me that the Baggage drop-off counter just got closed & I am late. I asked how you are taking her luggage, the agent told because she is having international ticket. My wife didn’t want to take the 7:00AM flight alone. So she took her luggage off from weighing belt. The check-in counter manager then advised us that, they would able do a complementary accommodation in next immediate flight & advised us to go to sales counter there & inform about this. We both went to Vistara customer service sales counter in Terminal-3. However the service representative there said that next flight I can take is at 5:50pm not 11:10 am. But she didn’t confirm my ticket & instead asked to wait. In the meantime my wife’s ticket was confirmed to 5:50pm flight by the booking agent. My ticket was still not confirmed until 12 noon. At this time the sales representative asked me to book a new ticket instead & pay the full price. I informed the representative that I was advised by check-in area manager that I would get a complementary adjustment in next flight. She asked me to bring the check-in area manager to sales counter which I couldn't do. By 1 pm, I went back to sales counter & wanted to pay the full price to book the ticket. At this time, the sales representative said there is NO ticket available to BBSR on 5:50pm and advised me to take next day flight.  I informed the counter that there is ‘available ticket’ showing online.  I went ahead and booked it using Vistara.com website by paying full for 5:50pm. But accidentally the first name in the new ticket was my wife’s first name instead of my first name.",no

I liked their internet it was really fast better than my office one. I recommend everyone to use Vistara - though its bit costly but its worth it.",yes
Vistara,10,"""Vistara was a fantastic experience""",S Reddy,26th November 2021,"✅ Trip Verified | I had flown from Delhi to Mumbai for some personal work. Vistara was a fantastic experience, they took great care of hygiene throughout the flight and this was the first time I experienced full flat beds in domestic business class within India. Business class seats had quite big screens for IFE and the service was pretty good as well given the pandemic. Since this was the morning flight, breakfast was scrambled eggs with paratha which was quite good with a bread roll and some fruits on the side, pretty good for a 1.5 hour long flight. Overall quite impressed, of course the pandemic has done away with the usual business class goodies of a welcome towel and a drink but then such are the times we live in.",yes
Vistara,6,"""disappointed with Vistara’s in-flight food""",Natarajan Sen,26th November 2021,✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely disappointed with Vistara’s in-flight food.

Vistara,9,"""very pleasant travel experience""",S Kavyaa,26th November 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  The service was nice, kind and prompt response from the staff, provided a small snack for 2.30 hrs flight. Seats and ambiance was much comfortable. No delays except the usual Delhi air traffic delay. The baggage reached safe. I am giving 9 points due to the behavior of one staff during check in process. He was hesitant to respond to my questions. Overall a very pleasant travel experience.",yes

I travelled in business class and I was the only one there. I had two check in suitcases under 25 kgs, 1 small bagpack and 1 cabin bag. I had one extra cabin bag which weighed 8 kgs. They did not allow me to take it on board and insisted me to pay £160 to check it in. I asked the agent if she can reduce the price a little if I have to check the bag in and she refused. Never am I ever going to do the mistake of travelling with this airline.",no
Vistara,1,"""Never again Vistara!""",S Fernandes,15th May 2021,✅ Trip Verified | Had a horrendous journey back to the UK as ground staff did not have any idea on transit rules by country nor were they familiar with bubble agreements. Manager shows a message on Whatsapp claiming to be a set of guidelines followed by them. Staff need to be trained in customer service especially if they claim to be part of Singapore Airlines delivering world class service. Ground staff at the booking counter at New Delhi airport seem to be fed-up of life and feel they're doing passengers a favour by answering their queries. Never again Vistara!,no
Vistara,9,"""eager to help and nothing was trouble at all""",L Hardani,15th May 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Right from boarding to landing, Vistara conducted it's duty with utmost sincerity and dedication. Premium economy cabins are spacious and so are seats. Cabin planning is good. They secure cabin from Economy class hence it feels private and less loud. The mood light shades they use are really appealing and food is just fantastic! In fact all flights originating from India, serves fantastic food! Hands down it's the best meal I have eaten on-board a flight. While I am at it, I might add that they can be bit generous with serving portions. IFE is bit boring and it needs more variety and latest movies. All this on one side and their cabin crew on another side. They elevate the experience on to another level. Vistara's crew are very professional and warm-hearted people. I could see that they are eager to help and nothing was trouble at all. Crew on DEL-FRA sector were the best crew I have experienced in my years of travel. They take individual orders from premium eco cabin and nothing comes from trolley. The whole experience made me feel at home. They exceeded the standards that of SIA and here after it will be my preferred airline to travel! If this level of service is maintained, once Vistara expands globally, it will give a run for buck to big 3 in gulf. Finally, it is an airline for here to stay and has a bright future.",yes
Vistara,2,"""I had missed my flight""",P Varwan,15th May 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had missed my flight due to service from the check-in team. For a flight of 8am, I was in the check-in line, having done mobile check-in earlier, before 6:45am. However, the check-in process took more than 30 min. By then, the person at the counter had refused to take my luggage and suggested that I just try 'my luck' by taking my luggage through security. I has asked in case the team can help me with security or thereafter through buggy. He said he can't help with either and this service was offered later once I missed my flight.",no
Vistara,9,"""amazing service and new aircraft""",A Banesh,15th May 2021,✅ Trip Verified |  One of the best full-service airlines in India with amazing service and new aircraft which are well maintained in terms of cleanliness and hygiene.

Vistara,8,"""In flight service was good""",Rahul Anand,15th May 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience, done web check-in and traveling without checking baggage so no check in experience, boarding was smooth. In flight service was good and so was food. Aircraft looks clean and hygienic.",yes
Vistara,9,"""Not a pleasant experience""",Rahul Anand,15th May 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Not a pleasant experience, starting from boarding to inflight. Boarding was chaotic, no social distancing. Food served to me was the same as economy class,  probably they have shortage of meal so served me the one for economy class. After boarding no one ask or provide water, only after take off.",yes
Vistara,1,"""no option other than to pay up""",Sahil Singla,15th May 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  The check in staff was not informed on the baggage policy, made me wait for about 15 mins while she checked with someone on call. There was no response from the other line and she made a random decision to charge me for my carry on bag (INR 8000) which was apparently way more than the cost of ticket itself. Her supervisor was just interested in moving the queue and she would not listen to the details of my booking. Eventually I was getting late for the flight and had no option other than to give in at that time to get my boarding pass. More details: I was flying from Chicago to Chandigarh and my domestic leg from New Delhi to Chandigarh was booked on United Airlines operated by Vistara. I had 2 check in bags + carry on bag + laptop bag, all under permissible weight limits and typical of an international flight from USA to India. I was not sure about the size of the aircraft in the domestic flight so I inquired if my carry on bag would fit in or not. They mentioned it won’t and even if it did it is above 7kg limit for a carry on bag and instead of taking the risk I should check in and pay for 15kgs instead. This was in spite of me showing them the Vistara policy which had to honour the same baggage allowance for connections from international flights within 48 hrs. Her recommendation was that I either magically get rid of my 8kg belongings or pay up to board the flight, given the departure time I had no option other than to pay up. To make matters worse the supervisor on the floor was completely rude and interested in chatting with her friends than pay attention to any questions from customers. Fast forward, I boarded the flight, half empty and huge spaces for carry on bags in the flights and knowing all that she still made me check in the bag for additional amount. I felt completely ridiculous and betrayed and I hope that the airlines invest some time in teaching manners and policies to their front end staff.",no
Vistara,9,"""expect an outstanding onboard experience""",Rajan Parrikar,15th May 2021,✅ Trip Verified |  Goa to Bombay in Business Class. We have come to expect an outstanding onboard experience on Vistara and this time it was no different. My one point of criticism was the transport from the aircraft to the terminal upon landing in Bombay: the bus was packed to the gills in complete disregard for the current pandemic situation we are in. What is the use of masks and face shields if you are going to have people brushing against you and breathing down your neck?,yes
Vistara,8,"""service onboard was flawless""",Rajan Parrikar,15th May 2021,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Bombay to Goa in Business Class in January 2021. Vistara made a show of following pandemic protocol by handing out masks and face shields before boarding. Then they promptly packed to the gills the bus that transports passengers to the aircraft (reason I am deducting 2 points in my rating). The service onboard was flawless, the seats very comfortable for short haul flights. Vistara Business is best premium option currently available in India.",yes
Vistara,10,"""I was very impressed""",H Shavun,15th May 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bengaluru to Mumbai by Vistara. Today I tried flying the new feeling for the first time and I was very impressed. I had checked in online for the flight and had the printout of the boarding pass however during check in I was really happy and appreciated with the check in agent Vidhya who was kind enough to give us an extra legroom seat for our flight which was not chargeable and that was hugely appreciated. Boarding and departure was well on time and the seat was quite comfortable and soft. The extra legroom seats were very comfortable and it was also a pleasant surprise to know that the airline have also started resuming their inflight meal services which consisted of a veg sandwich, cookies and a bottle of water. There was also the inflight entertainment Vistara World which was accessible from the devices but I didn't go through it in detail although it seemed it had a decent collection of bollywood / hollywood movies. Arrival was ahead of schedule and baggage retrieval was also very smooth. Overall I have to say that this was an excellent flight service for such a short journey, I can only imagine how much better flying on premium economy / business would be. If one is looking for comfort and luxurious flying you won't be disappointed with Vistara. I might travel in Premium Economy or Business in the future if possible. Highly recommend it.",yes

The Indian Government cancelled all domestic and internationals flights, including our domestic Vistara flight from Goa to Delhi. We asked the airline to give us a full refund for the flight that was cancelled. The airline refunded us half of the money back for the flight, saying that they didn't cancelled the flight, that it was government decision and that's why they charged a fee for the refund, and we only got back half of the money we payed. It's sad that a company like Vistara is profiting from a flight that never took place and that it is not willing to give a full refund to its customers specially in this time of crisis. I will not book anymore flights with Vistara again.",no

Vistara,1,"""won't be travelling with them again""",B Chardour,27th February 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Amritsar via Delhi, we had a short connection time of around an hour. The CCU to DEL flight was delayed thereby reducing transfer time severely. I raised it with the cabin crew and they showed no interest. We ran to the domestic transfer desk, up to that point there was nobody to help or ask. At the transfer desk vistara staff couldn't even be bothered to look at us: busy with their mobiles. I instructed them to call the ATQ flight team and let them know of our situation. They called them and asked ""what should I do with these people, do you want them on the flight?"". We were told we have to rush, I reminded them that their flight was delayed. The response was yes I know but now you run. The ATQ flight departed from Gate 52!! The opposite end of the airport. Upon check-in at CCU we enquired as to what will happen in case of a delay, we were assured that we will be collected and taken to the next flight, perhaps even a tarmac transfer: forget this, we weren't offered a buggie transfer to the gate in Delhi. Had I been travelling alone perhaps this wouldn't bother me so, however I was travelling with my elderly parents: in fact, my father celebrated his 80th birthday with a sprint through Delhi airport due to Vistara's incompetence. The return journey was equally bad in terms of a another hectic transfer and zero assistance from vistara. This time the chap at the transfer desk refused to call ahead and let them know we would be arriving. For all four flights the cabin crew were disengaged, service was slow. On the return, for both sectors non-veg meals were not available. It took an age for the bags to be delivered. Citing the above I asked Vistara to refund me the difference between Premium economy and economy as a premium service was simply not provided, they refused. We just received the standard template of apologies, needless to say won't be travelling with them again.",no

There seemed to be a problem but everyone looked a bit embarrassed to tell us. Finally, we were told that the checkin time had been exceeded. We were directed toward a manager. He looked annoyed when we came to talk to him and got rid of us by finding us a powerless assistant to talk to. We finally learnt that we had been overbooked, which is surprising as we arrived pretty early. The assistant told us ""good news, you'll get a full refund"" whereas it was obvious that we were not going to pay for a service we did not get. Vistara made things worse by refusing to buy another companies tickets. We finally bought a new ticket at our own expense and wasted a full day of holiday.",no

Vistara,1,"""stop flying this carrier""",Dinesh Jhunjhnuwala,10th November 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a gold tier member with Vistara and it is sad to see that their service standards going downhill. Yesterday I was flying from Hyderabad to Delhi with my wife and we were both booked on their Premium Economy class. I happen to have four upgrade vouchers which were given to me by a Credit card company which allows upgrade to the next class. Once I reached the airport, I told the check in lady that I had the vouchers and wanted to upgrade us to Business class and showed her the vouchers. She did not know what to do with them. She asked her senior  to come and have a look and he said that she should call up the ticketing counter and check if two seats were available in Business class and to tell them that two passengers wanted to use the vouchers for this upgrade. The ticketing people said it was fine so they asked that my vouchers be sent across to the ticketing people to carry out the formalities so that they could issue us the new Boarding passes in Business class. At that time, two gentlemen wearing the uniform of Vistara approached the Business class counter and got themselves checked in to Business class. This meant that the last two seats available got taken by the crew and they tell me that they can no longer offer me the two seats as the Business class is full. I got upset and told him that he had already allocated the two seats to us and also spoken to the ticketing people so why did he give up these seats. He then lied to me that they had confirmed booking. If that was indeed the case then why did the ticketing people agree to give us the two seats? I conveyed my displeasure  and told him that it makes no sense to be a Gold tier member and not be given priority to use these vouchers and they gave these seats to the crew who ought to have lower priority than the fare paying customers. He understood what I was saying and sent to the two gentlemen. Apparently one was nice enough to say that he would give up his Business class seat but the other person would not. They told us that we could consider taking up one of the seats in Business class. I declined the offer and told him that I would prefer to fly with my wife. As I was waiting for the check in, I also tweeted to the airline and explained to them what had transpired. They gave a standard reply that they would look into this and get back. Today a lady from Vistara reverted and apologised at the ""miscommunication"" between the ground staff and the controller. As I see it, there was no miscommunication and it was very clearly informed to me that we were getting the upgrade. To rub salt on my wounds, she gave a ""wonderful"" offer to extend a 10% discount on any one ticket for my future trip I might take on Vistara. She did not utter a word regarding the attitude of the crew who put self over the customer. I told her to keep her charity and I now intend to send them my four upgrade vouchers along with my membership card and stop flying this carrier.",no

It was also the first time and route where this airline was operating a Boeing 737 instead of A320. Even though my flight got delayed by an hour but as soon as we entered the flight, the cabin crew had smiles on their faces and were greatly looking after their passengers throughout the flight.

The cabin crew handed me the infant seat belt without any instruction. When the flight started moving, cabin crew instructed me to feed the baby during takeoff but by that time my baby was frantic and started crying and I was stressed out. Had the instruction and been given bit in advance, I could have prepared so to avoid inconvenience to my baby and fellow passengers. No clear instruction was given about how the seat belt has to be tied for an infant. A cabin crew came to inspect the seat belt before takeoff, she said it has to be tied around the infant and attached to my belt but did not wait to see if its been done correctly.",no

Vistara,10,"""best airline by far""",Anna Whyte,5th August 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bagdogra to Delhi. Without the fantastic and amazing service given by the staff and management at Vistara Airlines, I would not have been able to fly that day. I have a traumatic brain injury caused by a stroke and am extremely sensitive to noise and crowds. This is the worst airport I have ever encountered. I have flown there before so I was already feeling panicky. Luckily this time my 20 year old son accompanied me. Due to the roadworks throughout Sikkim, we had taken a private taxi early morning to reach IXB in time for our flight. We were very early so stopped at a good, quiet restaurant 15 minutes away from the airport. I took into the restaurant my BOSE sound cancelling headphones and silicone ear implants to make sure they were charged and ready for the impending chaos. We arrived at IXB 2.5 hours prior to departure. This airport has no priority security, no priority check in., no O disability facilities, NO lounge. To call it an international airport is a joke! As soon as the taxi pulled away I realised that I'ld left my headphones and silicone ear implants plus charger in the restaurant. I had a panic attack. My son sat me down in the shade where I vomited numerous times while he contacted the taxi driver and the restaurant. They had gone. My son has headphones so he gave me his but by now I was shaking and suffering Aphasia (inability to speak). He contacted Vistara staff who took me into the managers office, organised water, a calm and quiet space and informed us that they would board us last and 2 members of staff would accompany us through security. They helped my son with bag check in and boarding passes while other staff took care of me. They also helped us with items which we had left at the helicopter office. My son had an early morning flight from Delhi to Stockholm the next day. We both agreed that without the help of Vistara's amazing staff, in the worst conditions possible for my disability (IXB), he may not have made either flight as he would have been forced to take me to hospital. A big thank you to the Vistara Airline manager, who personally accompanied my son through security, and the professional staff at IXB and on board the aircraft. I first flew Vistara 1.5 years ago and have not flown another airline in India since then. This is India's best airline by far. The app works, the web site works and the level of service is far above most international airlines.",yes

I had to cancel one of the passenger travelling with me. Called customer care and he confirmed the ticket was cancelled. But I did not receive any refund or at least any message/mail confirming that the ticket was cancelled. When I requested them to send me cancellation/refund confirmations, they simply send me another link to pay 300Rs. For what I don't know the reason. Neither the refund amount around 1300(which informed by customer care executive) is also not reflected in my card.

Vistara,10,"""definitely be flying them again""",Sarah Moore,22nd March 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cochi to Chandigarh via Delhi. I was traveling alone in India for business. As a female, this wasn't the most comfortable experience. I had to go from Cochi to Chandigarh to see a vendor so I booked this flight at the last minute. When I got to the airport I learned about the weight limit for carry-ons. I begged and pleaded for them to make an exception because I had work materials and several other important items. I offered to pay for the bag but they said they really weren't able to allow weight overages in economy class. They could only do so for business class customers. The two agents tried hard to help me get an affordable business class. We weren't able to find any that were affordable, but they tried just about every thing they could to ensure that my bag was tended to. In the end they put special labeling on my bag  and did virtually everything they could to make sure my bag made it to my final destination. This meant a lot to me, given the circumstances. I've never seen service like this at an airline. They genuinely cared about my seemingly stupid luggage concern. The actual flight was great - organized boarding, great snacks, friendly airline attendants, and easy flight. This was so comforting and calming to me during a stressful time. Will definitely be flying with them again because I know that their service is impeccable and that if anything goes wrong they will do everything they possibly can to make it right.",yes
Vistara,3,"""I wasn't able to upgrade""",A Madilya,22nd March 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Chennai. I wasn't able to upgrade to Business class multiple times. The voucher upgrade that they offered through their CV frequent flyer program you would never be able to do so. It's only allowed 1 hr before departure which in a domestic route is full since they only have 8 business class seats. I have this feedback to them on my earlier flights as well when I wasn't able to upgrade. What a shame, I was just starting to like them.",no
Vistara,10,"""Food tasty and served hot""",Priyanka Ghosh,22nd March 2019,Not Verified | Chennai to Kolkata. One of the best experience I ever have had. Crew members are very cooperative. This flight had many passengers who were actually patients. The behaviour of the cabin crew towards them was really appreciable. Food I opted was veg and was tasty and served hot. The flight landed before time. I must specifically mention that the interior of the aircraft was a very modest one with light music being played. I wish Vistara continues this quality of service and quality of aircraft maintenance in future too.,yes

As I was entering the aircraft, I told the flight attendant that I was feeling dehydrated and if I could have a glass of water. She instantly gave me a bottle of water.

Vistara,9,"""a worthy option to choose""",Sumesh Dudani,13th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Lucknow to Delhi. I have flown with Vistara earlier and recently in August. Overall, what I like about this airline is that staff is friendly and helpful both on ground and in cabin. Seat pitch and quality is very nice plus flexibility to choose preferred seats is added advantage. On board services are very good and aircraft interior is fresh.  Only thing I felt was that while flying on short route the food given in premium economy was at par with the normal economy and they used to give a welcome drink earlier in premium economy but I didn't find that in this flight. Plus the quality of refreshment was not good as I have experienced earlier. But overall on long flights, its very good and overall a worthy option to choose for flying in India. Eagerly waiting for its international flights now.",yes
Vistara,7,"""a good experience""",T Ashyer,13th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Chennai left almost 45 minutes late. Thereafter there was congestion at the runway at the take off point. Further ahead,the seat belt sign was not switched off for another 45 minutes after take off siting bad weather. Thus it must have been almost two hours from the time one reported to the boarding gate till the time the seat belt sign was switched off. I was traveling with my elderly parents in their eighties who wanted to go to the wash room about 20 minutes after the flight took off but were not allowed. However, the flight attendants wheeled in the food trolleys and started serving food during that time when the seat belt sign was still on. Other than this issue, the staff were quite efficient and courteous. The leg room was better than other domestic airlines. The food was good and adequate and the overall experience was pleasant. Another, irritant pertains to the prevalent norm in Chennai wherein the staff who assist with the wheel chair haggle over receiving a hefty tip . Overall traveling for the first time with Vistara was a good experience.",yes

I have travelled a lot in last 2 years and have flown each of the Indian airlines, but Vistara is the best among all. For foreign travellers I recommend that if you want to travel within India, use this airline. The food was good, plus the aircraft was well maintained and clean.",yes
Vistara,10,"""hope they maintain that standard""",Arup Ghosh,13th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Delhi. I am a Platinum Member of their frequent flyer programme and have been so for two years now. Therefore my bias for this airline is obvious.  Vistara is the only Indian domestic airline which offers Premium Economy. Same 3+3 layout as Economy but with more generous legroom. Their Economy seats have a pitch of 31"" and recline of 3.5"" except the cramped last row. The Premium Economy seats have a pitch of 33"" and recline of 4.5"". Those extra couple of inches does make a huge difference. Reached Kolkata airport at about 6 am for my 7.05 am flight to Delhi. Had checked in online the previous night. Being a Platinum Member they offer complimentary lounge access. However, as happens often, there never is time to pop into the lounge. Went straight through security and to the boarding gate. Vistara boarding is always an organised affair. I really can't put a finger on what they do different but there never is the kind of melee that you see around boarding gates of most other airlines. They started boarding at 6.24 am. We were bussed to a distant stand. Quite a few minutes of bus ride. To a very far stand beyond the old terminal building. Now, if I have one complain with Vistara and indeed with most other airlines, is that the first flight out of the day is always from a non-aerobridge stand. The planes that come in late on the previous night are parked at stands away from the terminal. Every airline that does that, seems to avoid the expenditure of getting the aircraft to an aerobridge gate for the first flight out the next morning. Instead they subject you to an uncomfortable crowded bus ride. Vistara also does the same. Boarding was quick and orderly. The welcoming cold towel (hot in winters) is always a nice touch. Then they handed over the breakfast menu. Another nice touch. A round of water. Boarding complete and doors close at 6.50 am, well before scheduled 7.05 am departure. Then the Government owned Kolkata Airport's inefficiency took over. It wasn't till 7.06 am that we were pushed back. And another 10 mins odd before we were airborne. 20/25 mins on the ground after doors closed? I don't know who is to be blamed. I always enjoy the new planes, nice clean interiors, comfortable seats, the rather different purple and gold colour scheme. Even the cabin crew wear a purple and gold uniform. I always see the lady cabin crews wearing a similar metallic gold watch and pearl ear studs which go very well with the purple uniform. Haven't seen any other airline standardising the accessories that go with the uniform. That's a real neat touch. 30 mins into the flight and it was breakfast time. Meals are always a pleasure on Vistara. I am a hardcore non vegetarian but could not resist the Sabudana Khicdi and Medu Vada in Sambhar that morning with Starbucks coffee. Awesome. We were over Delhi well in time but were then a victim to the usual early morning congestion that's routine at Delhi. Inspite of that we were on the ground a couple of minutes earlier than the scheduled 9.25 am arrival. Aerobridge connected quickly and I was off the aircraft at 9.34 am. Very happy. Vistara seems to be setting a new bench mark in Indian domestic aviation. I sure do hope they maintain that standard.",yes

First the flight was delayed for about an hour. Secondly, this airline is yet to be accommodated at the main airport, hence their flights land at a remote location, from where they stuff you in buses and get to the airport. Thirdly, drivers of these buses are ill mannered and untrained, despite it being very hot and supremely humid he refused to put the air conditioning on, despite all the passengers requesting, screaming and someone on the verge of fainting.

I was flying Amritsar to Mumbai with Vistara. The flight got delayed by 3 hours approximately. I received sms regularly notifying me that the flight was delayed. We were offered meals at the airport, one move to compensate for the delay caused by them, which if you are travelling by any other airline, won't even offer a glass of water or juice. After entering the flight, the decor amazed me. We were again offered an in-flight meal, both the meals were delicious. Until the flight got ready for departure, every passenger received a personalised apology letter and to make up for this we were offered 10% discount vouchers for our next travel. I am sure any other airline wouldn't have even apologised for any delay. After getting down at Mumbai, my luggage got swapped with another flyer, the immediate response of the ground staff was commendable, they traced the customer and immediately and got the bags exchanged.",yes

The gentleman at check-in was extremely professional, courteous, and helpful, as were the rest of the staff. The aircraft was modern and clean. The only small downside on the whole flight was the fact that they run their own rewards program, rather than being integrated with existing international programs ie Flying Blue, or Star Alliance - hence after 15 flights so far this year, I have still only been credited with 13 of them.",yes

She apologized & after some time some how she offered me some fruits & cookies to eat. Really appreciable for what she did on right time.

Vistara,8,Vistara customer review,Souvik Das,24th March 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Mumbai. Vistara’s service is aimed at a premium overall appeal. The website interface is smooth, although the app could be better designed. Web check-in is smooth, and you don’t need to pay extra to pre-reserve a window/aisle seat of choice. Even spot check-in is easy, bag drops are always hassle free even in busy terminals like the T3 at New Delhi. The seats have comfortable leather. Leg and knee room is among the best, and you also get a coat hanger hook. However, no in-flight entertainment is a disappointment for a premium full-service airline. The food options are changing, and still remain decent. However, they were better when Vistara began, even though they still remain better than Jet Airways and Air India. The staff is very helpful and amiable, and  offer extra pillows and blankets. This was also the only domestic flight to offer a welcome drink in the Economy Class. Vistara is the best domestic airline in India in terms of quality, hospitality, cleanliness. The only thing really off-putting are the very few flights that they have right now even on popular routes, and the lacklustre Club Vistara membership programme.",yes

The connection time we had between two flights was only 1 and half hours and we were made aware that the luggage had to be collected in Delhi and then checked-in again in the other airlines to London. As my parents were travelling for the first time, they started panicking as they do not have enough time to collect the luggage, got to the other airline desk for check-in , immigration and to the gate. But Vistara Airlines helped and checked in the luggage in business class so their luggage would come first and they can collect immediately when they come out.

Finally I have to take my laptop in my hand and check in the baggage. When tried to log in feedback at their site then their site doesn't take any feedback.

It's on time performance, new and clean aircraft, fantastic service, good food, etc has made it my favourite. The website and app is simple and user friendly. I am impressed with its frequent flyer programme where the points accrued seem to be more than other airlines. Staff are courteous and the systematic boarding gives a feel good factor right from the beginning of the journey. Food served is nice and hot.

I was looking forward to flying on Vistara but it wasn't the greatest of experiences. First of all the flight was brought forward although this was due to restrictions in Delhi rather than Vistara's fault. Then because I had paid using an international credit card upon checking they said they would have to verify it before they could issue my boarding pass! I have never encountered this before so had to wait for about 15 minutes before they came and gave it to me. The flight itself took off and arrived some 45 minutes behind schedule. Seating was better than on Jet Airways domestic economy and the food served was OK for a short journey. Vistara seem to be offering a good product but it wasn't quite the positive experience I was hoping for.,yes
Vistara,10,"""A high quality product""",Rajan Parrikar,22nd January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Goa to Bombay in Business Class in an A320 in Jan 2017. A high quality product both on the ground and in the air. The aircraft are new, cabins and restrooms clean and well-maintained. The onboard staff provides excellent service. Special attention is paid to the food served (at least in Business Class). The menu card lists the calories of every item on offer. In my experience, Vistara is currently the best domestic airline in India, and by far. If inflight wifi is provided it would round off the package beautifully.",yes
Vistara,10,"""every aspect was faultless""",Rajan Parrikar,22nd January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Bombay to Goa in Business Class in an A320. Every aspect of this flight from check-in to boarding to in-flight service to baggage retrieval was faultless. The staff are well-groomed, efficient and warm. The cabins are clean although somewhat spartan (that is, no wifi or monitors). And for short-haul flights the seats are comfortable. I was glad that my bags emerged first and quickly (I was the only passenger in Business Class).",yes
Vistara,9,"""combines luxury with comfort""",T Gantog,22nd January 2017,✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Kochi. Vistara combines luxury with comfort and is a wonderful airline. I was travelling in Premium Economy I was the only passenger in both the Premium Economy and Business class cabin. The meal was delicious and I enjoyed a comfy seat with neck pillows and extra leg-room.  Just before landing the crew hand out a hot towel wipe. The flight was an on-time arrival and a warm good-bye by the crew..,yes
Vistara,10,"""meal options were nice""",Shivam Negi,22nd January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  I specifically chose their last departure from Delhi to Mumbai for various reasons, to check out the meal offerings and punctuality. The flight was ahead of schedule. The aircraft was the newest one and was clean. The boarding was done in a professional manner. Business, Premium Economy and then Economy. The seats are best in comfort especially if one is looking for a night flight. The meal options were nice and I loved the fact they were quite thoughtful as travellers prefer to have something light and not too spicy. The meal was accompanied with orange juice followed by coffee/tea service.",yes
Vistara,9,"""refreshingly great airline""",Savi Mull,22nd January 2017,✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Lucknow with Vistara. A refreshingly great airline to fly with. Smooth check in and boarding procedures at both airports. Short flights with a meal in a box which was not of that good quality. Flight attendants were helpful and warm. Seat pitch one of the best in the Indian skies. Clean cabins and great service. Highly recommended.,yes
Vistara,10,"""best 50 min flight i've taken""",D Amir,22nd January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Flew Vistara from Lucknow to Delhi in premium economy. It was a wonderful experience and definitely better than i've ever had on any 50 minutes flight previously. I have to say Vistara is better than the North American carriers i've flown with. They gave a hot / cold towel service and also coffe and tea run along with complimentry sandwiches, cookies, wipes etc. For me its the best airline and best 50 min flight i've ever taken.",yes
Vistara,10,"""would fly Vistara again""",Chandra Dubey,22nd January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Lucknow to Delhi. I flew Vistara for the first time and I was not disappointed.The website is easy to use and also they offer web check in and dont charge for seat selection. The food that was served was delicious, it was a short flight of 40 minutes so a snack box was served with an option of veg and non veg. All in all it was the best domestic flight I've had and would fly Vistara again.",yes
Vistara,6,"""crew friendly and welcoming""",Anitha Sathya,22nd January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Bangalore with Vistara. Friendly ground Staff, Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Cabin crew uniform isn't appealing to me.  Departure was delayed by more than 30 mins and no announcing as to why it is delayed. Onboard meal is included in ticket price. I ordered Non Veg meal, It tasted below average. Better legroom definitely compared to other airlines.",yes
Vistara,3,"""a really bad experience""",Avinash Sadarangani,22nd January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Guwahati to Delhi with Vistara. Took a last minute flight so had to pay a lot but it wasn't a very good experience. The positives - decent ground staff, better than many airlines and leg space was better than regular low cost airline carriers. However, cabin staff couldn't speak proper English and forget smiling faces. Everything felt temporary. From the ground staff (outsourced) or the old leased planes. Food and beverages offered can extract a maximum value of 500INR on the ticket price. You could spend 500INR and get a much better meal in any of the other airline carriers. Their entire gameplay is premium but nothing spelt premium to me. At least in regular economy class. The flight was mid-afternoon and it became quite warm in the flight. Adding to the heat was the seats which were leather. We kept asking the flight attendants to reduce the temperature but to no avail. Basically, a really bad experience.",no
Vistara,10,"""maintaining their higher standard""",A Bandey,9th October 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Lucknow. The seats and legroom in Economy is more than other indian airlines.  It was a short 45-50 minute flight but we were served a snack box with juice, delicious sandwich with options of veg and non veg along with delicious cookies.  Its been over a year that I have been travellin with them and they have been successfull in maintaining their higher standard and thats what makes them the new unique feeling of flying. I just hope they start streaming content to pax devices soon.",yes
Vistara,10,"""seats were unique and classy""",D Amir,9th October 2016,✅ Verified Review | Lucknow to Delhi in Economy Class on Vistara. A320 aircraft. The seats were unique and classy with leather covers and beautiful colours and winged adjustable headrests which we normally don't see on other Indian cariers in domestic flights. This is what makes Vistara more comfortable and I would definately prefer them over all other airlines in India. For me at the moment they are the best after the exit of Kingfisher in the past. I just hope they stream IFE or get the screens installed either of them would be a considerable improvement.,yes
Vistara,10,"""it a wonderful experience""",D Chopra,9th October 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  This was my first time in Economy with Vistara flying from Lucknow to Delhi. The ground staff and boarding were excellent. The seats even in economy are all upholstered leather with winged adjustable headrests and the cabin smells good and was cleaned thoroughly before we boarded even given the short time the cleaning staff got to clean the aircraft. The cabin crew gave all pax a snack box with a juice, hot cutlet, chapati, cookies, face wipes, tomato ketchup and a bottle of water which was all very tasty. All in all it a wonderful experience. They lack IFE which I think should be added soon and should be a must once they go international.",yes
Vistara,9,"""I enjoyed my journey""",Yamshi Sagir,9th October 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Lucknow to Pune via Delhi. I travelled with Vistara for the first time, booked economy ticket. Proper lunch and snacks were served, reading stuff was available. The staff was courteous and helpful. Overall, I enjoyed my journey, after hectic schedule at home while returning I find the flight quite comfortable. Being a economy flyer travelling this route frequently my experience with Vistara is best up till now compared to all others.",yes
Vistara,10,"""between 33-36 inch legroom""",D Kubin,9th October 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Lucknow in Premium Economy with dedicated check in, complimentary drinks, Priority boarding, pillows, Priority Baggage. Between 33-36 inch legroom and  the seats were leather with adjustable headrest. The meal was hot on this short 1 hour flight. And my baggage arrived right after business class and a person was at the belt taking off baggage and  helping us. They dont have IFE.",yes
Vistara,10,"""the product has been consistent""",Rajan Parrikar,9th October 2016,✅ Verified Review |  Goa to Mumbai. Air Vistara aircraft are new with well-maintained interiors. Business Class product provides comfort and efficiency for flights shorter than 2 hours. In-flight service is outstanding as is the quality of food served. If there is one area for improvement it is that they don't yet provide wifi or any other form of entertainment. I have now flown Business Class on Vistara 3/4 times in the past year and the product has been consistent.,yes
Vistara,10,"""the food was amazing""",D Bunay,9th October 2016,✅ Verified Review |  Lucknow to Delhi. I love the way the crew service and also the food was amazing. I was given a pre loaded tab with one way wifi in it and able to use WIFI phone streaming content to my phone directly. I can't wait for them to fly international.,yes
Vistara,10,"""best airline to fly in India""",M Theeran,9th October 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Delhi. Excellent service, hot food, Clean cabins and seats. Courteous and well dressed staff. I found it the best airline to fly in India and I hope they go international soon. They must provide inflight entertainment or a USB port on each seat.",yes
Vistara,8,"""turned out a pleasant experience""",Ravin Ramachandran Nair,9th October 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Mumbai. Vistara turned out to be a pleasant experience for my first flight experience. I was booked on an Economy seat and contacted on the day prior to departure with an offer to purchase Premium Economy service at INR 3,000 per seat which was a good deal. Check-in staff at both New Delhi and Mumbai airports were efficient and warm. Very engaging staff members at the dedicated counter for Premium Economy passengers. 20kg checked in baggage and airline was quite generous with cabin baggage too. Luggage was tagged as 'Priority'. Premium Economy Passengers were invited to board through a dedicated lane at both airports. The fleet is maintained new, smells good and appears clean. Cabin crew were friendly, but like most Indian flight attendants they were too pre-occupied with their checks and service formalities and the graciousness of the flight attendants of Singapore Airlines was lacking. Nevertheless, the flight attendants seemed to be far ahead of their other Indian counterparts. Leg room in Premium Economy was definitely enhanced with what appeared to be a 35"" seat pitch. No in-flight entertainment on board, yet. Their in-fight magazine indicated that wireless streaming of entertainment is scheduled to launch shortly. Ample and interesting reading material was available on board. In-flight service included warm towels and great food presented well. On arrival at both airports, it was interesting to note that all the bags that came out first had the Priority Tag on. They seem to take their Priority tag business very seriously. Vistara is an excellent product in the Regional Indian Market and they have all the makings of a Skytrax 4 to 5 Star rating. The airline makes their competition looking like a bunch of novices in the business.",yes
Vistara,9,"""my first experience was a good one""",Nandita Ahuja,9th October 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Delhi to Mumbai with Vistara in Premium Economy. My first experience was a good one. Seats were very comfortable, meal was tasty, the staff were warm and helpful and the flight was punctual. I might move my priorities from Indigo to Vistara.",yes
Vistara,10,"""provides an excellent service""",G Vakesh,15th June 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Varanasi to Delhi, and was my second time in Vistara, and an amazing experience. I have to say that all are so calm and good to provide better services, prices are good not so high. Meals are perfect. Thanks to Vistara that provides such an excellent service.",yes
Vistara,10,"""I really liked everything""",D Hoover,15th June 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Mumbai with Vistara. After a long time, this was first time that I really liked everything in a flight. Starting from the moment I checked in to actual flight, everything was just fabulous. The hostess was outstanding, the way she served drinks, food, etc and then collected garbage - looking through the seats for missed paper glasses left a decent impression with my wife and I. A pat for all the Vistara crew.",yes
Vistara,9,"""wish other airlines learn from them""",P Dayal,15th June 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to Delhi with Vistara. Excellent checkin, flight, comfort, food, service and attitude. Wish other airlines learn from them in India. I was sceptical at first not having any experience of them but we needn't have worried. Came to know later that it it jointly belongs to the Tatas and Singapore Airlines - two excellent brands. Wish them well and hope they fly to more destinations.",yes
Vistara,9,"""one of the best airlines in India""",Ankit Dubey,15th June 2016,"Delhi to Lucknow was my second time flying with Vistara, and it is one of the best airlines in India in terms of quality of staff, seating and their on time performance. The  best food in the Indian skies I believe and I love their fresh menu with amazing cuisines. I just hope Vistara adds IFE screens in their airplanes soon which it lacks. Their magazine is not that bad either.",yes
Vistara,10,"""scores over other airlines""",Vikaas Kalantri,15th June 2016,"Mumbai to Delhi, and I feel that Vistara is next in class. The seat space, service, food and staff. This airline scores over other airlines in India for domestic travel. The only issue is that it doesnt fly to much routes or I would fly them more. Truly an amazing experience.",yes
Vistara,8,"""Vistara was a good experience""",Rudra Bhattacharya,15th June 2016,"Goa to Mumbai, and Vistara was a good experience for travelling with family, No hassle check-in and good leg space, Flight crew was courteous and in flight meal was provided for even a short 1 hour travel. Definitely would like to travel with Vistara again and would recommend.",yes
Vistara,6,"""the journey was satisfactory""",Atharva Agashe,15th June 2016,"Mumbai to Bengaluru. This was my third time flying with this airline, but this time my experience wasn't as good as I expected. The first was at the check-in where my luggage was overweight. I didn't mind paying but the charge per kg for excess luggage was quite high. The inflight service was very good, as the staff were very nice and friendly, and food served was delicious and was different from the last time I flew. Overall, the journey was satisfactory.",yes
Vistara,10,"""value for money""",Abhishek Ghamande,15th June 2016,"Flew Vistara for the first time in February from Delhi to Mumbai. Amazing experience. Loved the new aircraft, food and service. Truly value for money. Surprised by the leg space in economy. Tasty food and served hot.",yes
Vistara,8,"""aircraft was new and fresh""",Samarendra Patra,15th June 2016,"Bhubaneswar to Delhi with Vistara. I had booked this flight just 1 day eelier and I had got a pretty good deal. The aircraft was new and fresh. They initiated boarding process before time which was good to see, there was no rush. They offered a choice from vegetarian and non-vegetarian breakfast. There were variety of beverages available: Tea and Coffee after the breakfast. Business Service at a price of an economy seat. But the seat was not comfortable to the extent as was expected from a TATA brand.  Still I recommend Vistara.",yes
Vistara,10,Vistara customer review,Shivam Negi,15th June 2016,"Mumbai to Delhi with Vistara. I had booked this flight 20 hrs before my travel and I had got a pretty good deal. During check-in I was informed that I have been upgraded to Premium Economy, which was a delight. The aircraft was new and fresh. The boarding was so calm, as they had initiated boarding process before time which was good to see, there was no rush.  The seat was comfortable. There were Two vegetarian and one non-vegetarian choice. I took the Oriental choice which was fab. Ras Malai and Green Salad were on the sides. There were variety of beverages available. Tea and Coffee after the meal. It was Business at a price of an economy seat. I recommend Vistara's Premium Economy.",yes
